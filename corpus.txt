forewordwe are a great country. with great people. in the last five years i have heard your stories, your hopes and your dreams. and i have heard too your frustrations.the countless people working as hard as they possibly can and still struggling to pay the bills. the young people with great ambitions but great anxieties about the future. the dedicated staff of our nhs, who are deeply concerned about its future. and all those who have served our country, are now retired, and ask where our country is going.this manifesto is inspired by you.i take a simple view. we are a great country, but we can be even betterthe fundamental truth that runs through this manifesto is that britain will only succeed when working people succeed. it is an idea at the heart of my beliefs. and it drives our better plan for a better future.it means a country where hard work is rewarded, with high skill, high wage jobs. an economy built on strong and secure foundations, where we balance the books.it means building a future for all our young people, so they can get world-class apprenticeships and access to affordable, higher education. it means strong public services, rescuing our nhs.it means strong communities, where power is shared by people in every part of the country and where we respond to peoples concerns about immigration, with proper controls.it means a britain where everyone plays by the same rules, including those at the very top of our society. and it means an outward looking country, engaged in the world for our national interest.for me, the privilege of serving as prime minister in our country would be for one purpose alone: to work every day to help build a country that works again for working people. this manifesto is our plan to achieve that goal.ed miliband

we will build a better future for britain
8a better future for britainbritain is a great country ready to build a better future.this manifesto sets out labours plan for national renewal.the british people, are known for tolerance, responsibility to others and for our belief in the value of hard work. we look confidently outward to the world. these are great british traditions - things we all believe in, things our country is good at. we are at our best when we work together. we see this every day in our workplaces, in our families, and in our communities. people want to get on, they want to give their children a better future, and they want to help to change britain for the better.but across britain working people also know a simple truth: the economy is not working for them. for years now, our economy has not rewarded everyone who put in a good, honest days work. however hard people work, many dont earn enough to make ends meet. too many have been driven from secure, full-time work, into precarious, badly paid jobs  many working on zero-hours contracts. time to enjoy friends and family is increasingly squeezed, as mothers and fathers juggle the demands of work and caring for children, and often an older relative.the problems mount for the next generation too. young people are taking on a mountain of debt to go to university and too many still cannot find a job worthy of their talents. we lack a proper system of vocational education and apprenticeships to give our young people the start in life that they deserve. we are not building the homes we need. our sons and daughters have been shut out of the housing market and too often they are forced to leave the communities where they were brought up.our economy and our system of government are failing people. many have come to believe that politics ignores the things that matter to them. too much power is unaccountable, concentrated in the market and the state, at the expense of individuals and their communities.many of these problems have been mounting for years. some, like the rise of inequality, are felt in countries all around the world. so the conservatives did not cause all of them, but they have made them far worse. their view is that economic success depends just on a few at the top. they think that insecurity
will make people work harder and that low pay is the only way to be competitive in the global market. they dont believe we can afford decent public services when times are hard. they have been giving power to large unaccountable firms rather than to people, and now they want to make deeper cuts in the next three years than we have seen in the last five years.there are some who believe there is nothing we can do to change things for the better. they feel powerless. they are losing faith that those with power will ever listen to them. we understand these feelings. but we believe we can renew our country and make a better future for working people. we have learned the lessons of the past. we were in government for thirteen years and left the country a far better place to live in. but we did not get everything right. we have learned and we have changed.labour is renewing our traditions as the party of work, family and community. we believe in a society of trust and mutual obligation, in which we look after the vulnerable, and people can bring up their families with hope for a better future. and we believe in helping people to help themselves, both to improve their own communities, and to achieve their ambitions.we are also the party of equality. we believe that no person should suffer discrimination or a lack of opportunity. the decisions we take in government will always be taken with this in mind. the policies in our manifesto will help remove the barriers that stand in the way of greater equality. we know we achieve more when we work together to challenge inequalities of power and build a common good.in this election, the country has a choice. we can continue with a conservative plan based on the view that success comes only from a privileged few at the top. or we can change direction, begin to return power to people and build an economy together in which everyone can contribute to a shared and enduring prosperity.we believe that britain only succeeds when working families succeed. as the economy at last recovers, people want the opportunity to use their skills and talents to make a better life for themselves and their children. our countrys greatest asset is the hard work and talent of our people.the labour party manifesto 2015 9
10a better future for britainlabours plan is to build firmer economic foundations for creating wealth, rewarding hard work and competing in the world.we will balance the books by cutting the deficit every year, with a surplus on the current budget and with national debt falling as soon as possible in the next parliament. this will need common sense spending reductions, outside of the protected areas of health, education and international development. we will ask those with incomes over 150,000 a year to contribute a little more through a 50p rate of tax. and we will build the high-skill, high-wage economy we need to raise tax revenues and control social security spending.we will improve the security and reward of working life by raising the national minimum wage to more than 8 an hour by october 2019, banning exploitative zero-hours contracts and promoting the living wage. we will create more paths to success for our young people by introducing a gold-standard system of technical education and training, and the guarantee of an apprenticeship for every school leaver with the grades.we will support families by expanding free childcare from 15 to 25 hours for working parents of three and four-year-olds, while doubling paid paternity leave for fathers. we will help with household bills freezing energy prices until 2017, while reforming the broken energy market. and we will make sure that at least 200,000 new homes a year are built by 2020, and that private renters get a fairer deal. the bedroom tax is cruel and we will abolish it.we will build up our nhs so that it has time to care, funding 8,000 more gps, 20,000 more nurses and 3,000 more midwives, paid for by a mansion tax on properties worth over 2 million, a levy on tobacco firms, and by tackling tax avoidance. and we will bring together services for physical health, mental health and social care into a single system built around the individual.we want a high quality education for all of our children. we will protect the education budget and raise teaching standards, making sure there are smaller class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds.
the common life we share is who we are as a country. not everyone is the same, but each of us sharing a sense of belonging, being valued equally and being able to contribute to the common good. immigration has made an important contribution to our economic and social life, but it needs to be properly controlled. with a labour government, migrants from the eu will not be able to claim benefits until they have lived here for at least two years. we will make it illegal to undercut wages by exploiting migrant workers, and work to strengthen integration within our communities. everyone who works with the public in our public services must be able to speak english.we will help to make communities safer, by protecting and strengthening neighbourhood policing, countering extremism, and putting in place tough new laws to reduce violence against women and child sexual exploitation.people want more say in the decisions that affect their lives. we, in labour, know that government has to do things differently. the old command and control politics  doing things to and for people, but never with them  will not work. we need a new approach to government that involves more people in decisions that affect them. so we will devolve more power and control, not only to scotland and wales, but to our great english cities and county regions too. and we will share power and responsibility with people in their communities to help them help themselves and shape their services in response to their local circumstances.our country faces global challenges of climate change, terrorism and the spread of disease. in particular, tackling climate change is an economic necessity and the most important thing we must do for our children, our grandchildren and future generations. a labour government will face up to these challenges and re-engage with the world. we will build alliances in europe, promoting our countrys interests and security, and standing up for human rights and social justice. we will work to reform the european union, and we will retain our membership of it.labours plan for national renewal will bring about real, meaningful change that each person will be able to feel in their daily life. we know that to make britainthe labour party manifesto 2015 11
12a better future for britaina better country, opportunity must belong to everyone and not just a few. we will lend a helping hand to all those who need it, but we will also ask more of individuals and communities. we can only rebuild our country if everyone plays their part and feels they have a stake in society.we believe in living within our means. we will not make promises we cannot keep, and we will not introduce changes unless they are funded. there is not a single policy in this manifesto that is funded by additional borrowing. not a single one.our plan is to build a secure, prosperous and more equal country open to the world, in which everyone has the opportunity to get on and do their best. we will provide strong and effective government but everyone will need to contribute and play their part. it will be hard, but working together we can do it.

we will build an economy that works forworking people
16building an economy that works for working peoplewe know a simple truth. britain only succeeds when working families succeed. it is how our country has won through in the past and how it will succeed in the future. but so many people are putting in the hours and not seeing the rewards. that is why there is a cost of living crisis. our first task in government is to change our economy so that it works for all of britains businesses and working people.the conservatives claim that the economy is fixed and that our country is on the right track. but the economy is not creating the productive, high-skilled and well-paid jobs that we need to raise living standards. the lack of rewarding work and training opportunities is trapping hundreds of thousands of young people in a cycle of benefits and low-paid, insecure jobs. and consumers are overcharged in markets they rely on to meet their everyday needs, whether to heat their homes or travel to work.for most of the 20th century, there was a vital link between the success of the country and family finances. as the country got better off, so did working people. but the link between the success of the country and the family budget has been broken. since 2010, working people are earning on average 1,600 less a year after inflation. we have seen the greatest fall in wages over a parliament since 1874.over five million people are in low-paid jobs, earning less than the living wage. there are 1.8 million zero-hours contracts. 1.3 million are working part-time because they cannot get a full-time job. half of all those in poverty live in working households. 900,000 people, many of them in work, used food banks last year.this cost-of-living crisis is bad for families, bad for business, and bad for britain. lower levels of pay have meant lower tax receipts and higher spending on social security.we will have to work and earn our way toward a more fairly shared and enduring prosperity. we are a great commercial nation that has been at the centre of global trade for centuries. we have a long tradition of innovation and enterprise.
we have been quick to seize the opportunities of the internet. we have big strengths to build upon: world-leading universities, an outstanding science research base, an open economy with one of the highest rates of foreign direct investment in the world, and many successful global companies.an inclusive wealth-creating economy works when there is a shared sense of responsibility, so we will be a government that is both pro-business and pro-worker. we value all our businesses as organisations of innovation and wealth production, and we will work strategically with them to create wealth. we value our trade unions as an essential force for a decent society and as guarantors of skills and fair wages.a strong economic foundationthe next labour government will balance the books. we will only lay a budget before the house of commons that cuts the deficit every year, which the office for budget responsibility will independently verify. we will get national debt falling and a surplus on the current budget as soon as possible in the next parliament and these fiscal commitments will not be compromised. we will tackle the root causes of the deficit by building a more productive economy with living standards that rise year-on-year.the conservative-led government promised to balance the books in this parliament. but this promise has been broken. the conservatives will leave the country borrowing over 75 billion this year.labours plan to balance the books means making tough, but fairer choices. we will reverse the governments top-rate tax cut so that the highest one per cent of earners, with an income of over 150,000, contribute a little more to help get the deficit down. we will stop paying winter fuel payments to the richest five per cent of pensioners, and cap child benefit rises for two years. outside of the protected areas of health, education and international development there will be cuts in spending. ministerial pay will be cut and then frozen until we have balanced the books. all proceeds from the sale of our stakes in lloyds and rbs will be used to repay the national debt.the labour party manifesto 2015 17
18building an economy that works for working peoplewe will live within our means. we have no proposals for any new spending paid for by additional borrowing. all of our commitments will be paid for by reducing spending elsewhere or by raising extra revenue. for example, we will introduce a tax on properties worth over 2 million to help raise the 2.5 billion a year for an nhs time to care fund  part of our plan to save and improve the health service. we will legislate to require all major parties to have their manifesto commitments independently audited by the office for budget responsibility at each general election.we will cap structural social security expenditure in each spending review so that it is properly controlled. we will implement the proposals of labours zero-based review, which has already identified savings we will make through reforming old government bureaucracies, devolving power and services to our towns and cities, and redesigning public services, and which we will continue in government. we will invest to prevent social problems rather than waste money reacting to them. and we will use digital technology to create a more responsive, devolved, and less costly system of government.fairer taxeswe will create a fairer tax system, helping those on middle and lower incomes by introducing a lower 10p starting rate of tax, paid for by ending the conservatives marriage tax allowance. we will not increase the basic or higher rates of income tax or national insurance. nor will we raise vat, and we renew our pledge not to extend it to food, childrens clothes, books, newspapers or public transport fares.our first finance bill will close the tax loopholes that cost the exchequer billions of pounds a year. we will introduce tougher penalties for those abusing the tax system, end unfair tax breaks used by hedge funds and others, and bear down on disguised employment. we will seek international agreement to make country-by-country reporting information publicly available, and we will act at home if agreement is not reached. british overseas territories and crown dependencies will be required to produce publicly available registries of the real owners of companies based there.
we will carry out an immediate review into the culture and practices of hmrc so that everyone follows the same rules and we increase the rigour of the tax system. and we will abolish non-dom status so that all those who make the uk their home pay tax in the same way as the rest of us.it is by tackling tax avoidance in this concerted fashion that we can reduce the deficit and protect the family budgets of working people.improving productivity and a new industrial strategylabour will improve productivity by building a long-term investment culture in the private and public sectors, and supporting small businesses in their growth to becoming british success stories of the future. with labour, britain will continue to have the most competitive rate of corporation tax in the g7.building world-class infrastructure will be crucial to fostering economic growth. we will create certainty for investors by taking a long-term approach to the major investment decisions facing the country. we will set up an independent national infrastructure commission to assess how best to meet britains infrastructure needs. it will make recommendations to government, monitor their implementation, and hold government to account. these measures and our long-term approach will help reinforce britains status as one of the worlds greatest centres of science and engineering.we will continue to support the construction of high speed two, but keep costs down, and take action to improve and expand rail links across the north to boost its regional economies. we will support long-term investment in strategic roads, address the neglect of local roads, and promote cycling.following the davies review, we will make a swift decision on expanding airport capacity in london and the south east, balancing the need for growth and the environmental impact.the labour party manifesto 2015 19
20building an economy that works for working peoplescientific discovery and technological innovation will drive economic advancement this century. we will introduce a new long-term funding policy framework for science and innovation, providing the stability and continuity that our companies and research institutes need to succeed.we will work to make britain a world leader in low carbon technologies over the next decade, creating a million additional green jobs. this aim will be supported by ambitious domestic carbon reduction targets, including a legal target to remove the carbon from our electricity supply by 2030, and a major drive for energy efficiency.our industrial strategy for the green economy will end the current uncertainty for investors, with a timetable for the green investment bank to be given additional powers so that it can invest in green businesses and technology. we will create an energy security board to plan and deliver the energy mix we need, including renewables, nuclear, green gas, carbon capture and storage, and clean coal.for onshore unconventional oil and gas, we will establish a robust environmental and regulatory regime before extraction can take place. and to safeguard the future of the offshore oil and gas industry, we will provide a long-term strategy for the industry, including more certainty on tax rates and making the most of the potential for carbon storage.labours longer-term approach will drive innovation and build on our strengths as a leader in digital technology. we are just at the start of the internet revolution. digital technology has transformed start-up costs making it easier to run your own business. there is a widening in the application of new transformative technologies in the fields of robotics, genetics, 3d printing and big data. our economy is developing a network of connections that will revolutionise innovation.labour will ensure that all parts of the country benefit from affordable, high speed broadband by the end of the parliament. we will work with the industry and the regulator to maximise private sector investment and deliver the mobile infrastructure needed to extend coverage and reduce not spots, including in areas of market failure. and we will support community-based campaigns to reduce the proportion of citizens unable to use the internet and help those who need it to get the skills to make the most of digital technology.
our universities are amongst the finest in the world. some are already helping our regional economies by forming strong links with industry and creating high-tech clusters. they have already spun out hundreds of companies creating thousands of jobs. we will support this model of knowledge clusters, especially outside the south east.britains economy is being held back by the culture of short-termism, which is a major obstacle to the development of productive businesses and industries. we will reform corporate governance to protect our leading firms from the pressure to put tomorrows share price before long-term growth potential.institutional investors will have a duty to act in the best interests of ordinary savers. they will have to prioritise long-term growth over short-term profits for the companies in which they are investing. we will change takeover rules to enhance the role of long-term investors by restricting voting to those already holding shares when a bid is made. in addition, we will strengthen the public interest test.we will improve the link between executive pay and performance by simplifying pay packages, and requiring investment and pension fund managers to disclose how they vote on top pay. and we will make sure employees have a voice when executive pay is set by requiring employee representation on remuneration committees.in this way we can start to create an economy based on mutual obligations, encouraging employers and employees to build partnerships for improving both business performance and job quality. outdated practices, like blacklisting, have no place in a modern economy.our charities, mutuals, co-operatives and social enterprises are pioneering new models of production that enhance social value, promote financial inclusion, and give individuals and communities power and control. we will continue to support and help develop the social economy by improving access for co-operative and mutual organisations to growth finance through the new british investment bank. and we will consider how to support employee buy-outs when businesses are being sold.the labour party manifesto 2015 21
22building an economy that works for working peoplewe will safeguard the public interest in the royal mail, supporting the creation of a staff-led trust for the employee share, and keeping the remaining 30 per cent in public ownership. we will also support the universal service obligation, ensuring competition does not undermine it and introducing protections as necessary.backing small businesssmall businesses are the backbone of our economy. their creativity and dynamism are vital for raising productivity and competing in the global economy. labour will give them a voice at the heart of government  a small business administration, which will ensure procurement contracts are accessible and regulations are designed with small firms in mind.we will address rising costs for small businesses and strengthen rules on late payment. labour will put small businesses first in line for tax cuts. instead of cutting corporation tax again for the largest firms, we will cut, and then freeze business rates for over 1.5 million smaller business properties.we will develop a banking system that works for businesses in every region and every sector in britain. the long-standing problems of our banking system mean that too many small and medium-sized businesses cannot get the finance they need to invest and grow.labour will establish a british investment bank with the mission to help businesses grow and to create wealth and jobs. it will have the resources to improve access to finance for small and medium-sized businesses, and will support a network of regional banks.we will increase competition on the high street. following the competition and market authorities inquiry we want a market share test and at least two new challenger banks. and we will deal with the scourge of household debt by introducing a new levy on payday lenders, using the funds raised to boost low-cost alternatives like credit unions.
better work and better paybritains route to prosperity and higher living standards is through more secure and better paid jobs. but conservative policies are causing whole sectors of the economy to be dragged into a race to the bottom on wages and skills. the government has weakened employment rights and promoted a hire-and- fire culture. labour believes our economy can only succeed in a race to the top  competing in the world with better work, better pay and better skills.too many people do a hard days work but remain dependent on benefits. we will raise the national minimum wage to more than 8 an hour by october 2019, bringing it closer to average earnings. we will give local authorities a role in strengthening enforcement against those paying less than the legal amount. and we will support employers to pay more by using government procurement to promote the living wage, alongside wider social impact considerations. our make work pay contracts will give tax rebates to businesses who sign up to paying the living wage in the first year of a labour government. publicly listed companies will be required to report on whether or not they pay the living wage.it is hard for britain to succeed when employees feel insecure and employers are undercut by those using exploitative working practices. labour will ban exploitative zero-hours contracts. those who work regular hours for more than 12 weeks will have a right to a regular contract. we will abolish the loophole that allows firms to undercut permanent staff by using agency workers on lower pay.the conservatives have introduced fees of up to 1,200 for employment tribunal claimants, creating a significant barrier to workplace justice. we will abolish the governments employment tribunal fee system as part of wider reforms to make sure that affordability is not a barrier to workers having proper access to justice, employers get a quicker resolution, and the costs to the tax payer do not rise.labour is the party of work, and we value working life. we will push up standards and boost productivity by implementing the commitments in labours workplace and business manifestos.the labour party manifesto 2015 23
24building an economy that works for working peoplesupporting the next generationover 700,000 of our young people are unemployed. too many of them do not have the skills they need for work. and yet in the past year the number of young people starting apprenticeships has fallen. the governments decision to triple university tuition fees leaves young people either starting their working lives burdened by 44,000 of debt, or without a clear alternative path to a decent career.labour will cut tuition fees from 9,000 to 6,000 a year, funded by restricting tax relief on pension contributions for the highest earners and clamping down on tax avoidance.we will tackle the growth of unpaid internships because thousands of highly able young people who cannot afford to work for free are locked out of too many of our professions.we will introduce a compulsory jobs guarantee, paid for by a bank bonus tax. it will provide a paid starter job for every young person unemployed for over a year, a job which they will have to take or lose benefits.for too long we have failed to provide a system which makes the best use of the talents of young people. so we will guarantee every school leaver that gets the grades an apprenticeship. we will create thousands more apprenticeships in the public sector, including the civil service. every firm getting a major government contract, and every large employer hiring skilled workers from outside the eu, will be required to offer apprenticeships.we will give employers more control over apprenticeships funding and standards. in return, we will ask them to increase the number of high quality apprenticeships in their sectors and supply chains. we will also give them the powers to deal with any free-riding employers who do not train.labours apprenticeships will be gold-standard qualifications. we will re-focus existing spending away from low-level apprenticeships for older people, and towards a system where apprenticeships are focused on new job entrants, lasting at least two years, and providing level three qualifications or above.
we will make sure that apprenticeships can lead to higher level qualifications by creating new technical degrees and supporting part-time study. they will be co-funded, co-designed and co-delivered by employers and they will be the priority for expansion within our university system.young people who do not have the skills they need should be in training, not on benefits. we will replace out of work benefits for 18 to 21-year-olds with a new youth allowance dependent on recipients being in training and targeted at those who need it most.mending the markets that people rely onlabour will stand up for working families and businesses against vested interests. we will reform the broken markets that people rely on most so that families and businesses get a fair deal.energy bills have risen by over 300 since 2010. many businesses say energy is the biggest cost they face. lack of competition and transparency has allowed the large energy companies to get away with increasing bills when wholesale prices rise, but not cutting them when they fall. the regulator has failed to take decisive action to protect consumers.labour will freeze energy bills until 2017, ensuring that bills can fall but not rise, and we will give the regulator the power to cut bills this winter. during the freeze, we will reform the energy market so that it delivers fairer prices and a better deal for working families. the generation and supply businesses of the big six energy companies will be separated. they will be required to open up their books, and they will have to sell their electricity through an open exchange. we will simplify energy tariffs and make it easier for people to compare prices to get the best deal. we will protect small businesses by ending unfair contracts and automatic rollovers to more expensive tariffs. a tough new energy watchdog will enforce our reforms, with powers to strip energy companies of their licences if they repeatedly harm the interests of consumers, and protect off-grid households.the labour party manifesto 2015 25
26building an economy that works for working peoplewe will bring down energy bills by making homes more energy efficient, delivering a million interest free loans for energy home improvements in the next parliament. for those on low incomes, we will make 200,000 homes warm every year, delivered street-by-street by local authorities and community organisations. privately rented properties will have to meet a decency standard, bringing warmth to a further three million homes.the water industry, too, also requires reform. one in five people struggle to pay their water bill. despite this, only a fraction of customers have benefited from the social tariffs offered by water companies. under our reforms all water companies will be required to sign up to a new national affordability scheme, helping those who cannot afford to pay their water bill. and we will strengthen the powers of the regulator to change licenses, limit price rises and enforce industry standards.living standards have been hit by fare increases on public transport. since 2010, rail fares have risen by 20 per cent, leaving passengers paying the highest fares in europe. similarly, bus fares have risen by 27 per cent while at the same time 2,000 bus routes have been cut.labour will reform our transport system in order to provide more public control and put the public interest first. we will review the franchising process as a priority to put in place a new system and avoid a repeat of the conservatives franchising fiasco. a new national rail body will oversee and plan for the railways and give rail users a greater say in how trains operate. we will legislate so that a public sector operator is allowed to take on lines and challenge the private train operating companies on a level playing field.rail fares will be frozen next year to help commuters while we implement reforms. a strict fare rise cap will be introduced on every route for any future fare rises, and a new legal right for passengers will be created to access the cheapest ticket for their journey.city and county regions will be given more power over the way buses are operated in their area. they will be able to decide routes, bear down on fares, drive improvements in services, and bring together trains, buses and trams into a single network with smart ticketing.
labour will:cut the deficit every year and balance the books as soon as possible in the next parliamentreverse the 50p tax cut so that the top one per cent pay a little more to help get the deficit downnot increase the basic or higher rates of income tax, national insurance or vatcut and then freeze business rates and maintain the most competitive corporate tax rates in the g7abolish non dom statusincrease the national minimum wage to more than 8 an hour by october 2019 and introduce make work pay contracts to provide tax rebates to firms becoming living wage employersban exploitative zero-hours contractsguarantee an apprenticeship for every school leaver who attains the grades and require any firm that gets a large government contract to offer apprenticeshipsreduce tuition fees to 6,000 a yearfreeze energy bills until 2017 and give the regulator the power to cut bills this winterintroduce a british investment bank and support a network of regional banks.the labour party manifesto 2015 27

we will provide world-class health and educationservices
32providing world-class health and education servicesour nhs, care services, schools, colleges and other public services make up the essential fabric of our society. people need them to be able to live secure and fulfilling lives. britain needs them if we are tosucceed as a country. but under the conservatives they are under threat. the next labour government will protect, improve and invest in our public services, while giving individuals and communities more control over their design and delivery.the nhs is one of our great national institutions, and it is one of labours proudest achievements. it embodies our belief that by the strength of our common endeavour, we achieve more than we achieve alone. but the future of the nhs is under threat. the conservatives have put the wrong values at its heart, and patients are finding it harder to get the care they need.care is at the heart of labours values. no-one should fear old age or be left to struggle alone caring for a loved one. but too many older people suffer insecurity, loneliness and exclusion. and the growing social care crisis is one of the biggest challenges we face. since 2010, billions of pounds have been cut from budgets that pay for adult social care. the result has been 300,000 fewer older people getting vital care services, at the same time as the number of older people in need of care is increasing.a good education is vital to achieving personal fulfillment and economic prosperity. a good society depends upon an education system that can open minds and teach the skills and knowledge we each need to get on in life. but our education system is failing to meet the needs of young people who do not follow the traditional academic path from school to university.our public services are a measure of the strength and decency of our society. but we need a change in how we design them by pushing power down and organising them around individuals and families not centralised bureaucracies. good public services also need committed staff who are treated fairly and whose ethos of service is respected. they require decisions on pay that prioritise those on lower incomes, which are evidence-based, and which respect pay review body recommendations rather than brushing them aside irresponsibly.
government spends far too much money dealing with the symptoms of problems, instead of investing smaller amounts in dealing with their causes. every taxpayer pays the cost of low educational achievement, poor aspirations, drink and drug misuse, and criminality. so we will promote early-years intervention, supporting young children and their parents and dealing with problems before they get out of hand.we can save money and create more responsive services by building co-operation between public services and organisations. pooling funds across local areas reduces inefficiency and avoids duplication. services must be joined up in ways that make sense to the people who use them.labour will use digital technology in reforming our public services. people will be able to feed back on services quickly and simply, making sure their voices are heard, stimulating improvement and saving on the costs of service failure.the nhslabour will rescue our nhs, invest in its future and join up services from home to hospital.we will start with the promise of investment so that the nhs has time to care. the nhs is struggling with staffing shortages. accident and emergency is in crisis, and more people are facing long waits for tests, treatment, or to see a gp. labour will invest in 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 more gps, and 3,000 more midwives, paid for by a mansion tax on properties worth over 2 million, a levy on tobacco firms, and by tackling tax avoidance. the threshold for the mansion tax will rise in line with house prices for these high-value properties, and those on lower incomes will be protected with a right to defer the charge until the property changes hands.we will guarantee people a gp appointment within 48 hours, and on the same day for those who need it. we will create a cancer treatments fund so patients have access to the latest drugs, surgery and radiotherapy. by 2020, patients will wait no longer than one week for vital cancer tests. catching the disease earlythe labour party manifesto 2015 33
34providing world-class health and education servicesis critical, so we will raise public awareness of symptoms and make sure there is training and support for gps in spotting early signs.the answer to the health challenges we face is not to set hospital against hospital, but to join up services around patients needs. we will repeal the governments health and social care act, scrapping the competition regime and restoring proper democratic accountability for the nhs. we will establish a sensible commissioning framework, based on the principle of an nhs preferred provider, to stop the drive towards privatisation and make sure that nhs services are not destabilised by competition and fragmentation. where private companies are involved in providing clinical services, we will impose a cap on any profits they can make from the nhs, to ensure that the needs of patients are always put first. we support the principles behind the negotiations on the transatlantic trade and investment partnership treaty (ttip). we will hold the european commission to account on issues of concern, including the impact on public services and the investor to state dispute settlement mechanism. and we will ensure the nhs is protected from the ttip treaty.our health reforms will focus on prevention and early intervention, and joining up services from home to hospital. when people cannot get to see their gp, many go to a&e instead. when mental health problems are not spotted early, people can deteriorate and need more intensive support. and when elderly people cannot get the care they need at home, they are more likely to end up in hospital.the current system is too fragmented. it was not designed for the growing numbers of people living with chronic conditions or multiple needs. rather than having three separate systems for dealing with physical, mental and social care, we will create a whole person approach: a single service to meet all of a persons health and care needs.this will be underpinned by new rights for patients. vulnerable older people, disabled people and those with complex needs will be helped to have more control of their lives with the entitlement to a personal care plan designed
with them and shaped around their needs, the option of personal budgets where appropriate, and a single named person to coordinate their care. they will also receive better information and advice on managing their condition. these changes will help to end the frustration of families sick of being passed from pillar to post between different individuals and agencies.commissioning and budgets will be brought together at a local level to join up services and make sure that providers are incentivised to help people stay healthy and outside hospital, rather than simply waiting for them to fall ill.mental health will be given the same priority as physical health. people will have the same right to psychological therapies as they currently have to drugs and medical treatments. to help address the problem of undiagnosed mental illness, nhs staff training will include mental health. we will increase the proportion of the mental health budget that is spent on children, and make sure that teachers have training so they can identify problems early and link children up with support. to support young peoples health and wellbeing, we will encourage the development of social and emotional skills, for example through the use of mindfulness to build resilience. and we will set out a strategy with the goal of ensuring that the great majority of patients can access talking therapies within 28 days, and that all children who need it can access school- based counselling.a greater emphasis on prevention and public health is essential, not just to improve outcomes and tackle inequalities, but to ensure the nhs remains sustainable. for example, 3.2 million people are currently diagnosed with diabetes, and it is estimated that spending on treatment will rise from 10 billion to 17 billion a year over the next 25 years if action is not taken, such as to reduce levels of obesity. we will set a new national ambition to improve the uptake of physical activity and take targeted action on those high strength, low cost alcohol products that fuel problem drinking. and we will set maximum permitted levels of sugar, salt and fat in foods marketed substantially to children.the labour party manifesto 2015 35
36providing world-class health and education serviceseveryone involved in the nhs must learn lessons when things go wrong, for example, from the failings at mid-staffordshire and morecambe bay. labour will prioritise action to improve care quality and patient safety. in addition to recruiting extra nurses to help provide safe levels of staffing on wards, we want every hospital death to be subject to an appropriate level of review. we will also take action to modernise the regulation of healthcare professionals.care in older agelabour will support people in their older age. growing old should be a positive and fulfilling experience. but our social care system is close to collapse, with older people often receiving visits limited to just 15 minutes, provided by a workforce that is too often undervalued.labour supports measures to cap the costs of care and will prioritise improving the quality of care services.working with local authorities and care providers, labour will end time-limited 15-minute visits, introducing year-of-care budgets to incentivise better care in the home. by stopping the use of zero-hours contracts, where regular hours are being worked, we will improve the working life of care workers.for older people, the normal setting for care should increasingly be the home, not the hospital. we will recruit 5,000 new home-care workers  a new arm of the nhs  to help care for those with the greatest needs at home. this will include supporting more people to remain at home at the end of their life, including those who are terminally ill with the greatest care needs.we will also introduce a system of safety checks to identify risks facing vulnerable older people and enable preventative measures to be put in place, such as grab rails to prevent falling.
the burden of the care crisis is falling on carers, especially women, who account for six in every ten carers. labour will introduce a new duty on nhs organisations to identify carers so that they can be linked up with the right support. we will ring-fence the money councils get for carers breaks to ensure this money gets spent on carers.a high quality education for all our childrenlabour sees investment in education as an investment both in our children and in the future of the country. we will protect the entire education budget, including the early years, schools and post-16 education, so that it rises in line with inflation.however investment on its own is not enough. we need to create a route to success for the 50 per cent of young people who do not go down the traditional academic route. we will raise the standard and status of vocational and technical education, with a high quality vocational route from school through to employment. the technical baccalaureate, a vocational award for 16 to 18-year-olds, will combine a gold-standard qualification accredited by employers, with a quality work placement.we will transform high performing further education colleges with strong links to industry, into new specialist institutes of technical education, with a remit to deliver the technical baccalaureate and higher-level skills. we will support more young people to gain the core skills they need for employment and further study. with labour, students will continue to study english and maths to age 18 and undertake work experience between the ages of 14 and 16. and to ensure young people are equipped to make the best choices for their future, we will introduce a new, independent system of careers advice, offering personalised face-to-face guidance on routes into university and apprenticeships.we believe fundamentally that a world-class education system is made by excellent teachers. with labour, every teacher will need to gain qualified teacher status. we will encourage teaching quality by creating new career routes for teachers who are expert in their subject. these teachers will be able to attainthe labour party manifesto 2015 37
38providing world-class health and education servicesa new master teacher status. teachers will also be expected to update their knowledge and skills as a condition of remaining in the profession, and we will support plans for a new college of teaching. these measures will help us close the attainment gap between disadvantaged children and their peers, and work towards all children reading well by age 11. we have supported the successful teach first since its inception and will continue to do so.a new school leadership institute will support headteachers and improve school leadership. it will accredit gold-standard headship qualifications, support leadership training and development, and identify and develop the school leaders of the future.the government has attempted to oversee thousands of schools from the centre. this approach is not working. underperformance is going unchallenged and parents do not have enough of a voice. labour will introduce new directors of school standards at a local level to monitor performance, intervene in underperforming schools and support them to improve.where a majority of local parents have concerns about underperformance, or a dip in standards, they will be able to call in their local director of school standards to hold a school to account.labour will promote innovation in schools. we will give all schools freedoms currently only granted to some. directors of school standards will be responsible for commissioning new schools where there is a shortage of school places, encouraging innovative bids from established providers, good local authorities, parents, teachers and entrepreneurs. they will also encourage local schools to work together to improve the quality of education.we will end the wasteful and poorly performing free schools programme, and switch resources to where they are needed, allowing us to cap class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds at 30 pupils or under.private schools currently benefit from generous state subsidies, including business rates relief worth hundreds of millions of pounds. we believe they should do more to contribute to raising standards in state education to justify receiving this subsidy. as a condition for continued business rate relief, private
schools will be required to form a meaningful partnership with a school, or cluster of schools, in the state sector.children develop and learn best when they are secure and happy. we need to help our children develop the creativity, self-awareness and emotional skills they need to get on in life. we will introduce compulsory age-appropriate sex and relationships education. we will encourage all schools to embed character education across the curriculum, working with schools to stop the blight of homophobic bullying.the labour party manifesto 2015 39

we will help our families and communitiesto thrive
44helping our families and communities to thriveas a country we value compassion, tolerance and a sense of decency. but pressures on family life, growing inequality, anxieties about crime and anti-social behaviour, and a widespread loss of trust in our governing institutions, are creating insecurity in many communities.labour believes a decent society grows out of family life and relationships, out of the work we do, and the local places to which we belong. we will help to create a more secure and inclusive society by building and strengthening the institutions that help individuals, families and communities to thrive.supporting families and relationshipspeoples relationships bind society together, and the family, in all its various shapes and sizes, is its bedrock. but low pay, the pressures of work and caring for children and elderly relatives, have put families under increasing pressure.we will help families by expanding free childcare from 15 to 25 hours per week for working parents of three and four-year-olds, paid for with an increase in the bank levy. we will also introduce a legal guarantee for parents of primary school children to access wraparound childcare from 8am to 6pm through their local primary school. as well as helping parents, this will provide children with before and after-school clubs and activities, helping to raise their aspirations and attainment. this will be underpinned by a new national primary childcare service, a not for profit organisation to promote the voluntary and charitable delivery of quality extracurricular activities.labour recognises the vital importance of the power of peoples relationships to build the capacity for love, care and resilience. we will prioritise early years intervention to give children and parents the best start in family life, and restore the role of sure start centres as family hubs. sure start will have an obligation to provide families with access to childcare, opening their facilities to charities and local childcare providers. more widely, we will encourage local services to co-locate, so that they work together to shift from sticking plaster solutions to integrated early help.
we will take a whole-family approach to policy making, supporting relationships, and the involvement of fathers, grandparents and relatives in the care, education and health of children.more fathers want to play an active role in their childrens lives and families want to spend more time together with a new baby. so we will double the current two weeks of paternity leave to four weeks, and increase the amount of paternity pay from 140 to more than 260 a week. many grandparents want to be more involved in caring for their grandchildren, and we will support them in doing so.as a result of this governments failures, the commitment to ending child poverty by 2020 is very unlikely to be met. however, we will never forget how important a decent basic income is to a childs prospects and wellbeing. that is why we will keep the child poverty targets, and ask the office for budget responsibility to monitor and report on progress.we will promote the care and educational achievement of our most vulnerable children and we will introduce mandatory reporting of child abuse. we will increase support for children in kinship (family and friends) care and their families, a group too often overlooked and undervalued. we will continue to support frontline and its innovative approach to training social workers, and teachers will receive better training for working with children with special educational needs and disabilities.building new homesbritain is in the midst of the biggest housing crisis in a generation, with the lowest levels of house building in peacetime since the 1920s. young people have been priced out of home ownership. fewer affordable homes are being built, homelessness is rising, and millions face insecurity and poor standards in the private rented sector.everyone should be able to live in a secure home, whether they rent or buy. we will make sure that at least 200,000 homes a year get built by 2020  almostthe labour party manifesto 2015 45
46helping our families and communities to thrivedouble the current level  by implementing the recommendations of the lyons review. it is only by building more homes that peoples aspiration for home ownership will be fulfilled.our comprehensive plan to tackle the housing crisis will give local communities new powers to provide the homes they need, in the places they want to live. to help young people and families get on the housing ladder, we will give local authorities the power to give first call to first time buyers on new homes in areas of housing growth. and we will unlock a future homes fund by requiring that the billions of pounds saved in help to buy isas be invested in increasing housing supply.we want a housing market that rewards the building of high quality homes rather than land banking and speculation. so we will introduce greater transparency in the land market and give local authorities new use it or lose it powers to encourage developers to build.we will increase competition in the housebuilding industry by backing small builders, including through our help to build scheme, and by getting the public sector building again. we will build more affordable homes by prioritising capital investment for housing and by reforming the council house financing system. we will give local authorities powers to reduce the number of empty homes, including higher council tax on long term empty properties. and to boost the housing we need, we will start to build a new generation of garden cities.for the 11 million people who rent privately, we will legislate to make three-year tenancies the norm, with a ceiling on excessive rent rises. a ban on unfair letting agent fees will save renters over 600. we will drive standards up by creating a national register of private landlords.homelessness is the ultimate symbol of the housing crisis. labour reduced homelessness by 70 per cent when we were last in office, but all forms of homelessness are back on the rise, with rough sleeping having increased by 55 per cent. we are committed to reversing this trend by tackling the causes of homelessness and rough sleeping.
restoring social securitybritain needs a responsible and fair social security system that provides security when people lose their jobs or fall sick, as well as a decent income when they retire. the british people have always believed in the principle of contribution, rewarding those who pay in, helping people get back on their feet, and providing support in times of need.to guarantee a decent social security system for the next generation, we need to keep costs under control. under this government, the increase in low pay has left working families more reliant on tax credits and housing benefit, pushing up the social security bill.to get the benefits bill under control, we need to tackle the root causes of rising spending, by making work pay and building more homes. we will allow local authorities that negotiate rent reductions on behalf of tenants who are claiming housing benefit, to retain some of the savings, on the condition that the money is invested in building homes.we will keep the household benefit cap and ask the social security advisory committee to examine if it should be lower in some areas. and we will cap structural social security spending as part of each spending review, so that it is properly planned and controlled.labour believes in rewarding work and in restoring contribution to the heart of our system. so we will not cut tax credits. we want everyone who can to have the chance to contribute through paid work, so we will create a more tailored back-to-work system that helps people secure and keep jobs. we will do more to help unemployed people get the skills they need for work, testing jobseekers maths, english and it skills within six weeks of them claiming benefits. they will be required to take up training where this will improve their chances of getting a job. we support the principle behind universal credit  that there should be a smooth transition into work  but it must be affordable and fit for purpose, so we will pause and review the programme.the labour party manifesto 2015 47
48helping our families and communities to thrivethere will be a guaranteed, paid job for all young people who have been out of work for one year, and for all those over 25 years old and out of work for two years. it will be a job that they have to take, or lose their benefits. and we will commission a replacement for the work programme at a more local level, working with local authorities to join up support for the long-term unemployed. we will introduce a higher rate of job seekers allowance for those who have contributed over years. it will be funded by extending the length of time people need to have worked to qualify.supporting disabled people to live independentlyalongside strong and responsive public services, the social security system plays an important role in supporting many disabled people to live independently, and must always treat sick and disabled people with dignity.half a million families have been hit by the bedroom tax, and two thirds of those affected are disabled, or have a disabled family member. it is cruel, and we will abolish it.we will reform the work capability assessment and focus it on the support disabled people need to get into work. we will give an independent scrutiny group of disabled people a central role in monitoring it. and we will introduce a specialist support programme to ensure that disabled people who can work get more tailored help.older peopleolder people deserve to live a fulfilling life, to continue working if they wish, and to enjoy a secure retirement. older people have contributed all their lives and built the britain that the next generation will inherit. so it is right that they are supported with a fair and sustainable pensions system, responsive health services and a system of care over which they have control. we will keep the triple-lock so that the state pension increases by inflation, earnings, or 2.5 per
cent, whichever is highest. and while increases in the state retirement age are necessary to keep our pensions system affordable, we will ensure that people have time to plan for changes.we have taken the tough choice to restrict winter fuel payments for the richest five per cent of pensioners, but we will guarantee that there will be no additional changes to the winter fuel payments, free tv licences or bus passes for pensioners.alongside a decent state pension, we must ensure private pensions are good value for those who have saved. we will reform the pensions market so that pension providers put savers first, and protect consumers from retirement rip-offs. we support greater flexibility for those drawing down their pension pots, but there must be proper guidance for people to avoid mis-selling.controlling immigration with fair rulesfor our country to stay strong, with the confidence to look outwards rather than inwards, people need to feel secure in the strength of our borders, our communities, and in the workplace.britain has seen historically high levels of immigration in recent years, including low-skilled migration, which has given rise to public anxiety about its effects on wages, on our public services, and on our shared way of life.despite the conservatives promise to reduce net migration to tens of thousands, it is now higher than it was when david cameron entered downing street. broken promises erode trust.labour will never cut britain off from the rest of the world. our economy and our society benefit from the talent and investment of people who come here, including university students coming to study. but the system needs to be controlled and managed so that it is fair. low-skilled migration has been too high and needs to come down. we need much stronger action to stop illegal immigration.the labour party manifesto 2015 49
50helping our families and communities to thrivelabours plan starts with stronger borders. we will recruit an additional 1,000 borders staff, paid for by a small charge on non-visa visitors to the uk. we will introduce stronger controls to prevent those who have committed serious crimes coming to britain, and to deport those who commit crimes while they are here. we will introduce full exit checks, so that we can count people in and out of the country. short-term student visitor visas have dramatically increased, so we will tighten the system to prevent abuse, whilst welcoming overseas university students who bring billions into britain. and we will keep the cap on workers from outside the eu.we need fair rules at work to prevent the exploitation of migrant workers, which undercuts local wages and increases demand for further low-skilled migration. labour will introduce a new law to stop employers undercutting wages by exploiting workers. we will ban recruitment agencies from hiring only from overseas and crack down on rogue agencies by extending the remit of the gangmasters licensing authority where there is evidence of abuse.we need to strengthen our social integration and ensure that migrants can play their part in british society. people working in public services, in public facing roles, will be required to speak english. those who come here will not be able to claim benefits for at least two years, and we will stop child benefit being sent to families living abroad.we will enforce immigration rules humanely and effectively. we will end the indefinite detention of people in the asylum and immigration system, ending detention for pregnant women and those who have been the victims of sexual abuse or trafficking. and we will ensure britain continues its proud history of providing refuge for those fleeing persecution by upholding our international obligations, including working with the un to support vulnerable refugees from syria.
safer communitiescrime creates fear and insecurity. we can only live happy and fulfilled lives if we know that we are safe, and that we are not at risk of violation of our person or property.for too many people in our country that is not the reality they see in their communities. neighbourhood policing, the vital building block of british policing, is at risk of being destroyed. anti-social behaviour is too often tolerated, rather than dealt with. violent crimes have gone up, but fewer violent criminals are being caught. far too many victims of child sex abuse are being let down by the services that are supposed to keep them safe.labour believes british policing is at its best when it is rooted in local communities, proactively preventing crime, rather than simply reacting to emergencies.we will protect neighbourhood policing. by making different choices  to abolish police and crime commissioners, end the subsidy of firearms licenses, and mandate police forces to work closer together  we will be able to safeguard over 10,000 police officers for the next three years. this will be backed up by a new statutory local policing commitment, guaranteeing neighbourhood policing in every community.we will strengthen community safety partnerships to give local people a role in setting priorities for neighbourhood policing and a say over the appointment of local police commanders.to raise standards within policing, all police officers will be required to become chartered officers, holding a registration with the college of policing, and able to be struck off for serious misconduct, just as doctors and lawyers can be. a new police standards authority will replace the discredited independent police complaints commission. and we will work with the police to improve ethnic minority recruitment so that the police better reflect the communities they serve.the labour party manifesto 2015 51
52helping our families and communities to thrivethe next part of labours plan is preventing crime occurring in the first place. we will nip anti-social behaviour in the bud by making offenders put right the wrong they have done, with payback orders replacing low-level cautions. and we will ensure staff who work with the public are given greater protection, with tougher penalties for those who assault them.the last labour governments reforms of youth justice, which required agencies to collaborate in preventing youth offending, reduced both youth crime and the numbers of young people in prison. the next labour government will extend this model, piloting a new approach to 18 to 20-year-old offenders, incentivising local authorities, police and probation services to work together to identify those at risk of drifting into criminal activity and, where possible, divert them into a more constructive way of life. and we will work to embed restorative justice right across the youth justice system.we know drug addiction continues to be a major cause of crime. we will ensure drug treatment services focus on the root causes of addiction, with proper integration between health, police and local authorities in the commissioning of treatment. and we will ban the sale and distribution of dangerous psychoactive substances, so called legal highs.it is clear that we need a radical change in our approach to dealing with child abuse. we will bring in tough new powers enabling the police to prevent an adult from contacting or communicating with a child if there is evidence of abuse, and strengthen the vetting and barring regime. a new child protection unit will be established to work across government, driving progress in the prevention of child abuse and sexual exploitation.we need prisons that both punish and rehabilitate people. labour will do more to increase the amount of time prisoners spend working and learning. prisons will be measured by how successful they are in reforming prisoners and reducing their re-offending. we will also raise professional standards amongst prison officers, including through the creation of chartered prison officers, and confront the neglected problem of staff corruption.
we will enact britains first victims law to give victims of crime a voice and an entitlement to minimum standards of service from criminal justice agencies.ending violence against girls and womentwo women a week are killed by a current or former male partner. at least 750,000 children a year witness domestic violence. stopping violence against women and girls is a priority for labour.we will publish a violence against women and girls bill, appoint a commissioner to set minimum standards in tackling domestic and sexual violence, and provide more stable central funding for womens refuges and rape crisis centres.we will strengthen the law, banning the use of community resolutions as a response to domestic violence. the gun licensing regime will be tightened, so that people with a history of domestic or sexual violence will not be given an unrestricted license. and we will make changes to dna retention, so that rape suspects have their dna recorded and stored.victims of domestic violence need far better support. so we will widen access to legal aid for victims of domestic violence.tackling the threat from extremismthe threat from islamist extremism is increasing. hundreds of british citizens have joined islamic state  a movement that has engaged in savage violence, and racial and religious hatred.the british people have faced down terrorist threats before and will do so again, standing united together, not allowing ourselves to be divided.with labour, the security services will have the powers they need to disrupt and tackle terrorism. the government were wrong to weaken counter terror powers by scrapping control orders. with labour, dangerous suspects will be subject to proper controls.the labour party manifesto 2015 53
54helping our families and communities to thriveevery government department will be engaged in the work of preventing extremism and fighting terrorism. we will implement a much more rigorous strategy for dealing with people returning from the syrian conflict. alongside appropriate police action and prosecution, it will be mandatory for anyone returning to engage in a de-radicalisation programme designed to confront them with the consequences of their actions.we will need to update our investigative laws to keep up with changing technology, strengthening both the powers available, and the safeguards that protect peoples privacy. this is why labour argued for an independent review, currently being undertaken by david anderson. we will strengthen the oversight of our intelligence agencies to make sure the public can continue to have confidence in the vital work that they do to keep us safe.to defeat the threats of islamist terrorism, we must also engage with the personal, cultural and wider factors that turn young people to extremism. the prevent programme was set up under the last labour government to stop young people becoming radicalised. but this government has cut the funding and narrowed its focus. much of the work to engage muslim communities has been lost.we will overhaul the programme to involve communities in countering extremist propaganda, stopping young people being groomed, and also building resilient institutions for social integration. we applaud those faith communities who have pioneered an inter-faith dialogue for the common good.we will take a zero-tolerance approach to hate crime, such as anti-semitism and islamophobia. we will challenge prejudice before it grows, whether in schools, universities or on social media. and we will strengthen the law on disability, homophobic, and transphobic hate crime.arts and culturelabour believes that art and culture gives form to our hopes and aspirations and defines our heritage as a nation. the arts allow us to celebrate our common
humanity in the creation and celebration of beauty. the arts should belong to all and be open to all to take part in.we will guarantee a universal entitlement to a creative education so that every young person has access to cultural activity and the arts by strengthening creative education in schools and after-school clubs. institutions that receive arts funding will be required to open up their doors to young people, and we will work with public bodies to rebalance arts funding across the country.the last labour government made admission to our national museums and galleries free to all, leading to a major increase in the number of people experiencing our greatest cultural treasures. we reaffirm our commitment to universal free admission to ensure that our great works of art and national heritage can be enjoyed in all parts of the country.creativity is the powerhouse of a prosperous economy. it is the source of economic innovation and a powerful force in social renewal. we will increase the number of apprenticeships in the creative industries.we will create a prime ministers committee on the arts, culture and creative industries, with a membership drawn from all sectors and regions. the committee will bring issues of concern direct to the attention of the prime minister.sportsport brings us together in an expression of our local and national pride. it is where young people learn about leadership, teamwork, the pursuit of excellence and strength of character. with a labour government our children will participate in a minimum of two hours of organised sport every week at school.football clubs are an important part of many peoples identity and sense of belonging. they are more than just businesses. but despite their importance in the lives of their members and supporters, too often there are no effective means for fans to have a say in how their clubs are run. labour will providethe labour party manifesto 2015 55
56helping our families and communities to thrivethe means for supporters to be a genuine part of their clubs. we will introduce legislation to enable accredited supporters trusts to appoint and remove at least two of the directors of a football club and to purchase shares when the club changes hands. we will also review the role of fan participation in other sports.we will ensure the premier league delivers on its promise to invest five per cent of its domestic and international television rights income into funding the grassroots.protecting our environmentwe feel passionately about our local landscapes, our open spaces and wildlife. land and nature are part of our common home and inheritance, and they contribute to our sense of identity. in a globalised world, our local environment provides us with a sense of place and belonging.as we set out in more detail later on, a labour government will play a leading global role in tackling climate change. however, it will not be enough to simply mitigate the threat of climate change. we must adapt to its damaging effects, which are impacting on us today. we will produce an ambitious adaptation programme, and the new infrastructure commission will prioritise investment in flood prevention. we will deal with the problems of air pollution by giving local authorities the powers they need, backed up by a national framework.labour has always believed that everyone should have access to nature, whoever they are, or wherever they live. so we will keep our forests in public ownership, and promote access to green spaces in local planning. we will support the work of the natural capital committee to protect and improve wildlife habitats and green spaces, and make them an important part of our thriving tourism industry.
we will build on our strong record on animal welfare  starting with an end to the governments ineffective and cruel badger cull. we will improve the protection of dogs and cats, ban wild animals in circuses, defend the hunting ban and deal with wildlife crime associated with shooting.we want to create a world-leading food, farm and fisheries sector that creates better paid jobs and apprenticeships across the rural economy. we will put in place a long-term strategy for the sector, promote the best of british produce, and expand the role of the supermarket watchdog to support the growth of the sector, and protect food producers from unfair practices by the major supermarkets.the labour party manifesto 2015 57
labour will:extend free childcare from 15 to 25 hours for working parents of three and four-year-olds, and ensure all primary schools guarantee access to wraparound childcare from 8am to 6pmdouble paternity leave from two to four weeks and increase paternity pay by more than 100 a weekensure at least 200,000 new homes a year are built by 2020, with first priority for local first time buyersprovide security for renters by guaranteeing three-year tenancies with a ceiling on excessive rent risesintroduce a compulsory jobs guarantee, paid for by a bank bonus tax abolish the bedroom taxensure migrants will not be able to claim benefits until they have lived here for at least two yearsmake it illegal for employers to undercut wages by exploiting workersprotect neighbourhood policing by safeguarding over 10,000 frontline police officers over the next three yearsgive football fans a voice in club boardrooms.58helping our families and communities to thrive

we will reform government to give more powerto people
62reforming government to give more power to peoplepeople who live in this country know that too much power is concentrated in too few hands. those who make decisions on behalf of others, whether they are in westminster, the european union, inbusiness, the media, or the public sector, are too often unaccountable. our over-centralised system of government has prevented our nations, cities, county regions and towns from being able to take control and change things for themselves. we will end a century of centralisation.labour believes meaningful and lasting change for the better is only possible when people are given the power to change things for themselves. our governing mission is to break out of the traditional top-down, 'westminster knows best approach', and devolve power and decision-making to people and their local communities.from the city of london to silicon valley the worlds best industries tend to be clustered geographically. and too often economic challenges can be too, from our coalfields to some of our isolated seaside towns. so a labour government will unleash the potential of our city and county regions to drive economic growth and prosperity. we will reform institutions and devolve power to deal with the causes of our economic problems, and we will encourage local authorities to innovate to better serve their communities.instead of imposing change on communities, we will give them more control over schools, health care, policing, skills, housing and transport, making use of their insights into what works and what does not. we will promote and encourage a model of citizenship based on participation and shared responsibility.these measures are the start of big changes in how we govern ourselves as a union of nations. they will begin to transform the relationship between the citizen and the state.we will further develop digital government to enable better communication, more collaboration, and sharing of data between services. it will make services and transactions more efficient and simpler for people to use. to create a more connected society we will support making digital government more inclusive,
transparent and accountable. we will continue to back the principle of open data by default, releasing public sector performance data wherever possible.a better politicswe will give 16 and 17-year-olds the vote by may 2016, and improve the curriculum for citizenship education, so young people have the knowledge they need to play a full part in british society. we will encourage young peoples volunteering and social action by supporting the #iwill campaign of step up to serve, and the national citizens service.drawing on the work of the political and constitutional reform committee, we will take steps to ensure that the move to individual electoral registration does not leave millions unregistered, nor lead to constituencies that fail to take into account the people who live in them. this will include block registration by universities and care homes, extending northern irelands successful schools initiative, and exploring the scope for an automatic system of registration. labour remains committed to reforming political party funding and taking the big money out of politics by capping individual donations to parties.we will safeguard our democracy by repealing the lobbying act, which has gagged charities, and replace it with a tougher statutory register of lobbyists. we will ban mps from holding paid directorships and consultancies. and we will reform the legislative process to strengthen the publics voice and to better hold the government to account.the united kingdomlabour believes in the historic union of our nations working together for the common good. but as devolution has continued to gather pace, our union now needs to evolve. as a priority, we will set up a people-led constitutional convention to directly address this and to drive political reform of westminster.the labour party manifesto 2015 63
64reforming government to give more power to peoplelabour is committed to replacing the house of lords with an elected senate of the nations and regions, to represent every part of the united kingdom, and to improve the democratic legitimacy of the second chamber. it is also time to consider how english mps can have a greater role in the scrutiny of legislation that only affects england. this includes the option put forward by sir william mckay, of a committee stage made up of english-only mps. these ideas must now be considered as part of the constitutional convention process.englandwe will embark on the biggest devolution of power to our english city and county regions in a hundred years with an english devolution act. it will transfer 30 billion of funding to city and county regions, along with new powers over economic development, skills, employment, housing, and business support. this will include control over local transport systems so that in future, local bodies can integrate trains, buses, trams and cycling into a single network. we will enable city and county regions to retain 100 per cent of additional business rates raised from growth in their area.fair funding will be restored across england, alongside longer term multi-year budgets, so that local authorities can plan ahead on the basis of need in their area and protect vital services. and an english regional cabinet committee, chaired by the prime minister, will be convened regularly, attended by the relevant secretaries of state and leaders of our major city and county regions.in return for greater devolution of funding and responsibility, we will establish local public accounts committees, so that every pound spent by local bodies creates value for money for local taxpayers.devolution does not end at town halls. local people know best about the complex problems they face, and they are best placed to work out how to solve them.the english new deal begins the process of giving individuals and communities more power and control over how they are governed and over the design of
their public services. it will support people who need care to live independently, help troubled families to turn their lives around, and make sure that every child has a good start in life with early-years intervention and quality childcare.we will give english people a stronger voice in shaping the future of their local nhs services. patients and the public will have a seat at the table from the very start of any process that draws up plans for change, including changes to hospital services.we will give local communities more power to shape their high streets, and so preserve their local identities. councils will be given the power to require particular types of shops to apply for planning permission, allowing them to restrict the number of payday lenders or other shops that are clustering on a single high street. communities will be able to review betting shop licenses in their area and reduce the number of fixed-odds betting terminals in existing betting shops  or ban them entirely  in response to local concerns.scotlandin september 2014, people across scotland voted overwhelmingly for change. labour will keep its vow and implement the smith agreement in full. and we will go further, with a home rule bill to give extra powers to scotland over tax, welfare and jobs. rates of income tax will be set in scotland. billions of pounds of social security spending will be devolved, including benefits that support disabled people. the work programme will also be devolved along with a greater ability to invest in capital projects.the new devolution settlement will recognise the strength and security offered by being part of the united kingdom. we will maintain the barnett formula, and scotland will continue to benefit from pooling and sharing resources across the uk.the labour party manifesto 2015 65
66reforming government to give more power to peoplewaleslabour will put welsh devolution on the same statutory basis as scottish devolution, with a clear principle that powers are devolved unless specifically reserved, and that a welsh legislature is a permanent feature of our constitutional arrangements. we will take forward proposals from the silk commission to extend the power the people of wales have over their elections, transport and energy. an all-wales policing plan will give the welsh people the ability to shape local policing in wales.wales must not be unfairly disadvantaged by the barnett formula. so while the conservatives have cut the welsh budget by 1.5 billion, we will establish a fair funding settlement for wales, with the guarantee of a funding floor.northern irelandlabour is proud of the role we played in bringing peace and stability to northern ireland through the good friday agreement, and successive agreements. a labour government will engage proactively with the northern ireland executive to support continued political progress, and deliver on its vision of a shared future. we will ensure the economic pact between the uk government and northern ireland executive is focused on stimulating jobs and growth which contribute to reducing unemployment and poverty in northern ireland. we will continue to work with the irish government to secure peace in northern ireland and strengthen relations between our two countries.rights and equalitythe labour party has always led on challenging prejudice and discrimination and we will continue to do so. people's differences are not excuses to treat them badly or unjustly.
the next labour government will go further in reducing discrimination against women, requiring large companies to publish their gender pay gap and strengthening the law against maternity discrimination. where there is evidence more progress is needed, we will enforce the relevant provisions within the equality act.we want our parliament to look more like britain. we are proud of our record in strengthening the representation of women, ethnic minorities, and other under-represented groups in politics and public life. we remain committed to achieving a better balance in parliament, including through the use of all- women shortlists in labour party parliamentary selection contests.we will establish a comprehensive race equality strategy to break down the barriers still faced by black and minority ethnic communities. our aim is to make sure our national institutions, including parliament, the police, judiciary, civil service, and the boardrooms of our companies, are more representative of our diverse country.we will also build on our history of championing lgbt rights, tackling homophobia with tougher laws at home and greater engagement abroad.britain has a long tradition of liberty and the rule of law, and labour has a proud record of extending these to our most vulnerable citizens, by promoting equality and opportunity for all.thanks to the human rights act, some of our most vulnerable citizens, including disabled people and victims of crime, have been given a powerful means of redress. the conservatives want to leave the european convention of human rights, and abolish the human rights act. a labour government will stand up for citizens individual rights, protecting the human rights act and reforming, rather than walking away from, the european court of human rights. and we will make sure that access to legal representation, a cornerstone of our democracy, is not determined by personal wealth, but remains available to those that need it.the labour party manifesto 2015 67
68reforming government to give more power to peopleour freedom of information laws have shone a light into the darker corners of government and are a crucial check on the power of the executive. we will extend their scope so that public services run by large private companies are included. and we will repair the damage done by this government to the vital safeguard offered by judicial review.the mediathe free flow of information and of different points of view is crucial for open debate and countering concentrations of unaccountable power. that is why the concentration of media power in too few hands is damaging to our democracy. no one media owner should be able to exert undue influence on public opinion and policy makers. no media company should have so much power that those who run it believe themselves above the rule of law.yet the current system for protecting against these threats is inadequate. labour will take steps to protect the principle of media plurality, so that no media outlet can get too big, including updating our rules for the 21st century media environment.we remain strongly committed to the implementation of the recommendations of the leveson inquiry. we expect the industry to establish a mechanism for independent self-regulation, which delivers proper redress for individuals, as set out in the royal charter, and agreed by all parties in parliament. we made a promise to victims of the phone hacking scandal. we stand by that promise and will keep it.our system of public service broadcasting is one of britains great strengths. the bbc makes a vital contribution to the richness of our cultural life, and we will ensure that it continues to do so while delivering value for money. we will also commit to keeping channel 4 in public ownership, so it continues to produce vital public content.

we will stand up for britains interests in europeand the world
74standing up for britains interests in europe and the worldwe live in turbulent times. the rise of isil, an aggressive russia threatening its neighbours in eastern europe, and continuing economic uncertainty in the eurozone, are each a challenge to our national security. labour is an internationalist party and believes britain must engage with the global challenges we face, but not try and solve them on our own. we believe the conservatives are damaging the interests of our country by turning their backs on europe, and isolating us abroad. we will strengthen our national security, stand up for human rights, and work with other countries to tackle terrorism, climate change, and eliminate extreme poverty globally.britain has a unique influence in the world. we are the only country that is a member of the un security council, nato, the g7, the g20, the commonwealth and the eu.with labour, britains response to threats to our security will be based on enduring principles. we will protect our national interests, and strengthen our long-standing international alliances, in particular, our membership of nato and the european union. we will advance our international engagement, rather than retreating into isolation. we will maintain the best armed forces in the world, capable of responding to changing threats in an unpredictable security landscape. and we will support human rights, always putting individual freedom and democracy at the heart of our foreign policy.one of our first acts in government will be to conduct a wide-ranging review of britains place in the world and how we can best uphold our values and the national interest.global challengeswe will take a multilateral approach to global challenges. we will continue to uphold our key alliances. these include the united states, our allies in africa and latin america, and our partners from across the commonwealth. they
also include the european union. the crisis in ukraine over the past year has demonstrated the importance of nato and the eu standing up to external threats in europes eastern, and southern neighbourhoods. labour will continue to advocate an eu which looks outward to promote stability, peace and prosperity on its borders.most immediately we will work with our allies to counter and confront terrorism. isils barbarism and expansionist ideology, alongside terrorist groups such as al qaeda and al-shabaab, represent a particular threat to global security. following a request from the iraqi prime minister, it was right that the uk joined other nations in air strikes against isil targets in iraq. but military action alone will not defeat isil. a long-term multinational political strategy, with regional actors playing a central role, is essential for tackling the rise of extremism across the region.a labour government will always do what is necessary to defend our country. beyond self-defence, labour has been clear about the need to learn the lessons of previous interventions, especially the 2003 invasion of iraq. we will continue the approach we have taken in this parliament. a labour government would not propose the use of military force without judging whether reasonable diplomatic efforts have been exhausted, the action is proportionate and in partnership with allies, whether there is a clear legal basis, and if there is a clear plan, not just for winning the war but also for building a lasting peace.peace and security in the middle east are one of labours most important foreign policy objectives. we remain committed to a comprehensive two-state solution  a secure israel alongside a viable and independent state of palestine. there can be no military solution to this conflict and all sides must avoid taking action that would make peace harder to achieve. labour will continue to press for an immediate return to meaningful negotiations leading to a diplomatic resolution.labour will also continue to honour the uks commitment to support afghanistan as it seeks to secure an inclusive and durable political settlement. in december 2014, the nato-led isaf mission in afghanistan ended. we can never repay the debt owed to the brave servicemen and women who havethe labour party manifesto 2015 75
76standing up for britains interests in europe and the worldsacrificed and risked their lives in afghanistan to protect our national security.as power and wealth continues to shift from west to east, our relationship with asia will be fundamental to our long-term prosperity. labour will set up an asia step-change taskforce to ensure a more strategic and effective dialogue with regional partners, including china, both in the commerical realm, and in other areas, from cultural exchange to human rights.this commitment to universal human rights will be at the heart of our foreign policy across the world. we will continue to promote womens rights. we will join with those campaigning to attain gender equality, the eradication of poverty and inclusive economic growth. we will appoint a global envoy for religious freedom, and establish a multi-faith advisory council on religious freedom within the foreign and commonwealth office. and we will appoint an international lgbt rights envoy to promote respect for the human rights of lgbt people, and work towards the decriminalisation of homosexuality worldwide.europelabour believes that our membership of the european union is central to our prosperity and security. it is why we will work to change the eu, so that it operates in the best interests of our country. and it is why we will re-engage with our european allies to protect our national interest after five years of britain being sidelined in europe and isolated abroad.the economic case for membership of the eu is overwhelming. over 3 million jobs in the uk are linked to trade with the european union, and almost half of our trade and foreign investment comes from the eu. competing in the single market, with the best companies in the world, drives competitiveness and innovation for firms in all parts of our economy. and it helps boost the living standards of people across britain, encouraging the inflow of capital and investment.
our reforms will help deliver a europe focused on jobs and growth, not simply more austerity and rising unemployment. labour will focus on the completion of the single market and tougher budget discipline, including on those items where spending at the eu level can save money at the national level. that means driving reform of the common agricultural policy and a commission-led zero-based review of spending on eu agencies to reduce waste and inefficiency. we will not join the euro, and we will ensure eu rules protect the interests of non-euro members.a labour government helped to introduce sensible measures at eu level to protect the rights of british workers, and we remain committed to fighting to protect these measures.people coming to britain from the eu to look for work are expected to contribute to our economy, and to our society. so we will secure reforms to immigration and social security rules, as well as pushing for stronger transitional controls, which will enable member states to manage the flow of workers for longer when new countries join.we will also continue to open up eu decision-making, and implement institutional reforms to help build levels of trust among european citizens. we will work to strengthen the influence national parliaments over european legislation, by arguing for a red-card mechanism for member states, providing greater parliamentary scrutiny.labours priority in government will be protecting the nhs and tackling the cost-of-living crisis. it is not to take britain out of europe. however, labour will legislate for a lock that guarantees that there can be no transfer of powers from britain to the european union without the consent of the british public through an in/out referendum.defence and our armed forcesthe primary duty of any government is the defence of the nation and its interests. that is why labour is committed to ensuring the uk has responsive, high-tech armed forces, with the capability to respond to emerging, interconnectedthe labour party manifesto 2015 77
78standing up for britains interests in europe and the worldthreats, in an unpredictable security landscape. we will conduct a strategic defence and security review in the first year of government, with an inclusive national debate on the security and defence challenges facing the country. it will be fiscally responsible and strategically driven, focusing on the obstacles that impede our armed forces from effective response to threats.at the heart of our defence policy are the service men and women, both regulars and reservists, who risk their lives for their country. labour will strengthen the covenant between our nation and our armed forces, veterans and their families. we will create a veterans register to make certain our veterans receive proper support on leaving service.we will continue to roll out labours veterans interview programme, in which companies voluntarily guarantee an interview for job-seeking ex-forces personnel. we will introduce legislation to make discrimination against members of our armed forces illegal, and we will enshrine the military covenant in the nhs constitution.the uk defence and security industry is a key contributor to our economy, with a turnover of 22 billion a year. we will work to secure defence jobs across the uk, protect the supply chain and support industry to grow britains defence exports. in partnership with industry, we will put accountability, value for money, interoperability and sustainability at the centre of defence procurement.britain needs to be prepared to counter the threat of cyber-attacks. we have already called on the government to require every company working with the ministry of defence, regardless of its size or the scale of its work, to sign up to a cyber-security charter. this would reduce the risk of hackers using small suppliers to break into the systems of major defence companies or the department itself. we will consult on creating a statutory requirement for all private companies, to report serious cyber-attacks threatening our national infrastructure.labour remains committed to a minimum, credible, independent nuclear capability, delivered through a continuous at-sea deterrent. we will actively work to increase momentum on global multilateral disarmament efforts and
negotiations, and look at further reductions in global stockpiles and the numbers of weapons.climate changewe will put climate change at the heart of our foreign policy. as the terrible impact of the floods in britain showed last year, climate change is now an issue of national, as well as global security. from record droughts in california, to devastating typhoons in the philippines, the world is already seeing the effects we once thought only future generations would experience.the intergovernmental panel on climate change has made clear that if the world is going to hold warming below two degrees (the internationally- agreed goal), global emissions need to peak in around 2020, and then decline rapidly to reach net zero emissions by the second half of this century. the weaker the action now, the more rapid and costly the reductions will need to be later.the effects of climate change hit the poor, the hardest. if we do not tackle climate change, millions of people will fall into poverty. we will expand the role of the department of international development to mitigate the risks of a changing climate, and support sustainable livelihoods for the worlds poorest people.we want an ambitious agreement on climate change at the unfccc conference in paris, in december. we will make the case for ambitious emissions targets for all countries, strengthened every five years on the basis of a scientific assessment of the progress towards the below two degree goal. and we will push for a goal of net zero global emissions in the second half of this century, for transparent and universal rules for measuring, verifying and reporting emissions, and for an equitable deal in which richer countries provide support to poorer nations in combatting climate change.the labour party manifesto 2015 79
80standing up for britains interests in europe and the worldinternational developmentwe are proud that labour mps passed the historic law that commits britain to spend 0.7 per cent of our gross national income on international development. labour will use that commitment from the british public to transform the lives of the worlds poorest people, whilst ensuring value for taxpayers money. we will work in fragile and conflict-affected states to improve the lives of those affected by violence, prioritising the protection and education of women and children. we will rebalance the budget to focus funding on the worlds poorest countries.while progress has been made towards the millennium development goals, it is unacceptable that over a billion people still live on less than $1.25 a day. we will work with other countries at this years sustainable development goals summit to unite the world to eradicate extreme poverty, tackle growing economic inequality, and place human rights at the heart of development. we will establish a centre for universal health coverage to provide the support, encouragement, and global partnerships needed to help countries provide free healthcare. we will lead efforts to reshape the un humanitarian system to better equip it to save lives.the private sector is essential to long-term development, and is often a positive force for change. we will extend the sharing of tax information to developing countries, increase dfids help to governments to collect more of their own taxes, tackle corruption, and ensure good governance. we will work with companies to ensure they have sustainable supply chains that are free from slavery, treat their workers fairly, and pay taxes where they are due.

time for changein this election the country has a choice.either we can carry on as we are, with an economy that might work for some in the city of london but shuts out millions of people in the rest of the country. a country in which young people are left facing a worse life than their parents and an nhs under huge strain faces a real threat to its future.or we can change direction, together, with labour.we don't promise the earth. all our commitments in this manifesto are fully funded, so they can be delivered without a penny of borrowing.but our policies will bring hope and make britain work for working people once again.working people want an economy with better jobs and higher skills. families want to know they are guaranteed decent schools and good healthcare. mothers and fathers want a better future for their children. individuals and communities in every part of our country want to have control over their lives and for those in power to be held to account. everyone, young and old, wants a sense of belonging and safety in their communities.we deserve a country where everyone plays by the same rules, including those at the top.that's what this manifesto offers. it is the kind of country we know we have it in ourselves to be. let's build it together.the labour party manifesto 2015 83

conservative government will secure a better future for you, your family and britain.3the conservative party manifesto 2015forewordover the last five years, we have put our country back on the right track. five years ago, britain was on the brink. as the outgoing labour treasury minister put it with brutal candour, there is no money since then, we have turned things aroundbritain is now one of the fastest growing major economies in the world. we are getting our national finances back under control. we have halved our deficit as a share of our economy. more people are in work than ever before. britain is back on its feet, strong and growing stronger every daythis has not happened by accident. it is the result of difficult decisions and of patiently working through our long-term economic plan. above all, it is the product of a supreme national effort, in which everyone has made sacrifices and everyone has played their partit is a profound conservative belief that our country is made great not through the action of government alone, but through the flair, the ingenuity and hard work of the british people  and so it has proved the last five years.we can be proud of what we have achieved so far together, and especially proud that as we have taken hard decisions on public spending, we have protected the national health service, with 9,500 more doctors and 6,900 more nurses, and ensured generous rises in the state pensionour friends and competitors overseas look at britain, and they see a country that is putting its own house in order, a country on the rise they see a country that believes in itself but our national recovery remains a work in progress it is fragile, and with the wrong decisions, it could easily be reversedso the central questions at this election are these: how do we maintain our economic recovery, upon which our ambitions for our country depend? and how do we make sure that the recovery benefits every one of our citizens, at every stage of their lives?this manifesto sets out our plan to do just that it is a plan for a better future  for you, for your family it is a plan forevery stage of your life for your new-born baby, there will be the world's best medical care for your child, there will be a place at an excellent school. as you look for your first job, we are building a healthy economy that provides a good career for you with a decent income. as you look for that first home, we will make sure the government is there to help. as you raise your family, we will help you with childcare and as you grow older, we will ensure that you have dignity in retirement throughout, we will make sure that if you or your family fall ill, you will always be able to depend on our cherished national health service to give you the care you needand in an increasingly dangerous and uncertain world, we will fulfil the most basic duty of government  to defend our country and keep it safebut all of these things depend on a strong and growing economy so as you consider how to vote, i hope you will ask this: which party is best placed to keep our economy strong? the team which has delivered the growing economy we have today, which created more jobs since 2010 than the rest of the european union put together; or the party which left behind a ruined economy just five short years ago?now is a time to build on the progress we have made, not to put it all at risk this manifesto is our plan of action  our plan to take our amazing country forward. above all, it is a plan for you.i hope you will give it your support, so that together, we can see through the task we have begun5the conservative party manifesto 20156 securing a better future for you, your family and britainthe conservative party manifesto 2015a strong economy to help you and your familyour commitment to you:your job, your home, the mortgage you pay, the school your children go to, your local hospital, your pension  all these things depend on a strong economy. so we will carry on working through our long-term economic plan. we will:keep our economy secure by running a surplus so that we start paying down our debts increase the tax-free personal allowance to 12,500 and the 40p income tax threshold to50,000commit to no increases in vat, national insurance contributions or income taxcrack down on tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance and ensure those who can afford to pay the most dorebalance our economy, build a northern powerhouse and back elected metro mayors pursue our ambition to become the most prosperous major economy in the world by the 2030s.our long-term economic plan is turning around britains economy five years ago, britain was reeling from the chaos of labours great recession; in 2014 we were the fastest growing of all the major advanced economies  last year, we grew 75 per cent faster than germany, three times faster than the eurozone and seven times faster than france. five years ago, the budget deficit was more than 10 per cent of gdp, the highest in our peacetime history, and the national debt was rising out of control; today, the deficit is half that level and debt as a share of national income will start falling this financial year.the fastest growing of all the major advanced economies in 2014industries are coming back to life companies are striding into new markets manufacturers are returning to our shores more tech companies are starting up here than anywhere else in europe we have overtaken france as the third largest car producer in europe and there are 760,000 more businesses than in 2010 providing jobs and creating wealth across the countrythe great recession has given way to a great revival, which is creating on average 1,000 new jobs every day: more than the rest of the european union combined this is no accident it is the product of hard work by people in every part of the country and it is thanks tothe success of our long-term economic plan by halving the deficit, we have helped to restore confidence to the economy. by maintaining fiscal discipline, we have helped keep mortgage rates lower than they otherwise would be and by establishing the independent office for budget responsibility (obr), we have ended  permanently  the ability of politicians to cook the books for political gainat the nations expense. with inflation at a record low, the latest obr forecasts show that living standards will be higher in 2015 than in 2010, and are set to grow strongly every year for the rest of the decade, with the average family 900 better off. it is only by securing the recovery, dealing with our debts and creating jobs that we can continue to raise living standards that means sticking to our long-term economic plan; britain is on the right pathbut the job is not finished. there are clouds on the international horizon. huge challenges remain at home. we have cut the record deficit we inherited to five per cent of gdp, but that is still too high our trade with emerging economies is up, with exports to china more than doubled since 2009, but overall we are still tooan economic plan to help you and your family71. an economic plan to help you and your familydependent on slow-growing european markets business investment is rising, but we still underinvest compared to other countries productivity remains too low and while prosperity is now spreading around the country, our economic growth remains uneven, too reliant on financial services.1,000 jobs created for every day of the parliament since 2010we will finish the job we started in a balanced way. those with the broadest shoulders have contributed the mostto deficit reduction  which is why inequality has fallen, and child and pensioner poverty are down  and they will continue to do so we will increase nhs spending every year. we will control spending, eliminate the deficit, and start to run a surplus we will go from stuck in the red, to back in the black by building on the foundations we have put in place, we will have a truly national recovery and be able to pursue our ambition for britain to become the most prosperous major economy in the world by the 2030sif we do not stick to our long-term economic plan, we will slip back again, reversing the progress we have made in the last five years. more borrowing  and the extra debt interest that it brings  means there is less moneyto spend on schools and hospitals more spendingmeans higher taxes for hardworking people, and interest rates that are higher than they otherwise would be  punishing homeowners, hurting businesses, costing jobsa strong economy allows us to invest in and protect our public services like the nhs and schoolsand failing to control our debt would be more than an economic failing; it would be a moral failing  leaving our children and grandchildren with debts that they could never hope to repayso you face a clear choice economic competence, with david cameron as prime minister, following throughon our long-term economic plan or economic chaos under labour, with higher taxes, more debt and no plan to fix our public finances, create jobs or build a more secure economyour plan of action:we will finish the job by eliminating the deficit to keep our economy secure and keep your taxes and mortgage payments downour long-term economic plan reflects our values: we as a nation should not be piling up and passing on unaffordable levels of debt to the next generation we will eliminate the deficit in a sensible and balanced way that will enable us to continue to increase spending on the nhs and cut income tax for 30 million working peopleour deficit reduction plan has two phases. the first will see us continue to reduce government spending by one per cent each year in real terms for the first two full financial years of the next parliament, the same rate as over the last five years. that means saving 1 a yearin every 100 that government spends we dont think theres a business that couldnt do that  and we dont think government, when it is spending your money, should be any different.we have halved the deficit as a share of our economythat will require a further 30 billion in fiscal consolidation over the next two years, on top of the 120 billion that we have already identified and delivered over this parliament. we will find 13 billion from departmental savings, the same rate of reduction as in this parliament. we will find 12 billion from welfare savings, on top of the 21 billion of savings delivered in this parliament and we will raise at least 5 billion from continuing to tackle tax evasion, and aggressive tax avoidance and tax planning, buildingon the 7 billion of annual savings we have delivered in this parliament this 30 billion of further consolidation is necessary to ensure that debt keeps falling as a share of gdp and to deliver a balancedthe conservative party manifesto 20158the conservative party manifesto 2015structural current budget in 2017-18, meeting the new fiscal mandate that parliament voted on earlier this year.our commitment goes further than this a balanced current budget is not enough to deliver a reliable reduction in our level of national debt, which remains far too high in a world of continuing economic challenges international evidence and treasury analysis shows that the only way to keep our economy securefor the future is to eliminate the deficit entirely and start running a surplus anything less would be to ignore the lessons of the pastthat is why, in the second phase of our deficit reduction plan starting in 2018-19, we are set to move into surplus, with the government taking in more than it is spending for the first time in 18 years. that means we can start properly paying down our debts and reducing the scale of annual interest payments  reducing the uks vulnerability to future shocks by fixing the roof while the sun is shining. we will achieve this by continuing to control government spending in 2018-19, no longer cutting it in real terms, but instead growing it in line with inflation.to eliminate the deficit we must continue to cut out wasteful spending and make government more efficient, effective and accountablefrom 2019-20, after a surplus has been achieved, spending will grow in line with gdp a new fundamental principle of fiscal policy, monitored by the independent obr, will ensure that in normal economic times, when the economy is growing, the government will always run a surplus in order to reduce our national debt and keep our economy secure, with a state neither smaller than we need nor bigger than we can afford. total government spending as a share of our national income at the end of the next parliament is forecast to be very slightly higher than in the year 2000, the year before labour lost all control of spending and the national debt started its longest rise for hundreds of yearsour approach is focused on reducing wasteful spending,making savings in welfare, and continuing to crack down on tax evasion and aggressive avoidance this means that we can commit to no increases in vat, income tax or national insurance tax rises on working people would harm our economy, reduce living standards and cost jobs. instead, as we reduce the deficit, we will cut income tax, as we have done over the last five years: during the next parliament, we will increase the tax-free personal allowance to 12,500 and the higher rate threshold to 50,000, so you keep more of your hard-earned moneythe richest are paying a greater share of income tax than in any of labours 13 yearswe will continue to build a stronger, safer and more secure banking system that serves its customers and provides businesses with the finance they need to grow and create jobswe will make sure our financial services industry is the best regulated in the world with our new system of supervision led by the independent bank of england our new financial policy committee will monitor and control the growth of indebtedness and imbalances across the whole economy  a vital task that was totally ignored in the run up to the financial crisis. our tough new financial conduct authority will protect consumers and ensure that financial markets work for the benefit of the whole economy to protect hardworking taxpayers from future banking crashes, we will finish the process of ring- fencing banks high street branches from their investment arms by 2019 at the latest in order to ensure that new pay structures for bankers rebuild trust and reduce short- termism, we will ensure that britain continues to have the toughest regime of bonus deferral and clawback of any financial centre. we will continue to sell the governments stakes in the bailed-out banks and building societiesin order to deliver value for money for taxpayers and support the economy hardworking taxpayers supported the banks during the financial crisis and so the banks should in turn support them during the recovery  thatis why we will keep the bank levy in place and restrict established banks ability to pay less tax by offsetting their profits against past losses.an economic plan to help you and your family91. an economic plan to help you and your

will improve our support for investment into start-ups and roll-out our innovative help to grow scheme, which will plug a 1 billion finance gap for firms that are looking to expand, invest and take on new employeeswe will continue to lead the world on tax and transparencytackling tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance and tax planning is an important part of our long-term economic plan we will increase the annual tax charges paid by those with non-domiciled status, ensuring that they make a fair contribution to reducing the deficit, and continue to tackle abuses of this status we will lead international efforts to ensure global companies pay their fair share in tax, as david cameron did at the g8 summit in northern ireland in 2013, which secured significant international progress on fairertax rules and full transparency over who really owns companies we will push for all countries to sign upto the extractive industries transparency initiative; review the implementation of the new international country-by-country tax reporting rules and consider the case for making this information publicly available on a multilateral basis we will ensure developing countries have full access to global automatic tax information exchange systems and continue to build the capacityof tax authorities in developing countries we are also making it a crime if companies fail to put in

our 50 billion commitment to build high speed 2  the new north-south railway linking up london with the west midlands, leeds and manchester  and develop high speed 3 to join up the north. we will back scientific and technical strengths by creating new institutions such as health north; the royce institute for advanced materials in manchester, leeds, liverpool and sheffield; the national centre for ageing science and innovation in newcastle; the cognitive computing centre at daresbury; and by making investments in energy research in blackpool, cumbria and thorntonwe will back new jobs in the

out universal broadband and better mobile phone connections, to ensure everyone is part of the digital economy.under labour, road and rail were starved of resources, while too many people were stuck on the wrong side of the digital divide this meant packed trains, potholes, patchy broadband coverage  businesses held back and cities left behind turning these problems around takes timeimproving our trains, roads and broadband helps local businesses grow and create more jobs and opportunitiesbut because we have made savings elsewhere, wehave been able to make significant investments in infrastructure we will commit, alongside running a surplus, to increase our capital spending  investment in infrastructure  at least in line with our national income we have set out a plan to invest over 100 billion in our infrastructure over the next parliamentthis will fund the biggest investment in rail since victorian times, and the most extensive improvements to our roads since the 1970s and it will give us thewe are investing over 2 billion electrifying our railwaysmost comprehensive and cheapest superfast broadband coverage of any major european countryour plan of action:we will

labour government we will deliver on our national infrastructure plan and respond to the airports commissions final report.we will transform our railway networkwe will invest 38 billion in our railway network in the five years to 2019. electrification of the railways is a key part of our investment programme, with work already underway across the north, the midlands, and south wales; thereare plans to go further in the rest of the country, including east anglia and the south west in addition to rolling out our national high-speed rail network, with high speed 2 and high speed 3, we will complete the construction of the new east-west crossrail across greater london, and push forward with plans for crossrail 2, a new rail route running through london and connecting surrey and hertfordshire we will support a fairer deal for taxpayers and commuters: we will keep commuter rail fares frozen in real terms for the whole of the next parliament  regulated fares will only be14able to rise by retail price inflation, and train operating companies will not have any flexibility to raise ticket prices above this we will also introduce smart ticketing and part- time season

wi-fi equipment and improving mobile phone signals, which will benefit passengers on trains across england and waleswe will support motorists and invest in our roads, to save you time and moneywe

to create two million new jobs, so we achieve full employmentgive businesses the most competitive taxes of any major economyback small firms with a major business rates reviewsupport three million new apprenticeships, so young people acquire the skills to succeedif you want to live in the most vibrant and dynamic country in the world, this election matters only the conservatives have the vision, the optimism, the ambition and the discipline to transform britain thats because we know that a decent job is the best weapon against poverty and the best way to provide security for familiesbritain has created more jobs than the rest of the eu put together since 2010thanks to the success of our long-term economic plan, britain is creating more jobs than the 27 other countries of the european union put together that means more people with the security of a regular pay packet over the past five years, 1.9 million new jobs have been created; 1,000 jobs for every single day that we have been in governmentthis represents a transformation in many peoples lives; giving families more security; boosting the self- esteem of young people taken on; and providing hope for those who have been unemployed for yearsbut we need to go further we have set out the bold aim of achieving full employment, with the highest employment rate of any major economy we want britain to be the best place in the world to start a business and will create another two million jobs overthe next parliament we will abolish long-term youth unemployment, and make sure that all young people are either earning or learning and we will make our economy more inclusive, by removing barriers that stop women and disabled people from participating in our workforcea job is the best way to provide security for familiesto achieve this, we will back british businesses: cutting red tape, lowering taxes on jobs and enterprise, getting young people into work, boosting apprenticeshipsand investing in science and technology with the conservatives, britain will be the best place in europeto innovate, patent new ideas and set up and expand a business we aim to be number one in europe and in the top five worldwide in the world banks doing business rankings by 2020 and to lead europe in attracting foreign investmentbacking business also means helping our farmers andour rural communities neglected for 13 years under labour, we have started the process of championing and connecting up the countryside in the coming years, we will go further, helping our farmers, supporting british food around the world and opening up new export marketsjobs for all172. jobs for allthis is all at risk if the labour party forms the government their policies to spend more, borrow more and tax more would be catastrophic for britains businesses  and for all the families thrown back into the despair of joblessness and financial uncertainty.our plan will help to generate jobs and higher wages for everybodyour plan of action:we will boost apprenticeships and help you secure a good jobwe have already delivered 22 million new apprenticeships over the last five years. over the next five years, we will deliver three million more and ensure they deliver the skills employers need we aim to achieve full employment inthe uk, with the highest employment rate in the g7, and we will help businesses create two million jobs over the parliament we have abolished the jobs tax  employers' national insurance contributions (nics)  for the under 21s and next year we will do the same for young apprentices under 25 we will continue to help smaller businesses take on new workers through the employment allowance, which frees businesses from the first 2,000 of employers nics so that a third of employers pay no jobs taxwe will support business to keep creating 1,000 jobs a day over the next five yearswe will aim to abolish long-term youth unemploymentour economic plan has helped deliver sharp falls in long- term youth unemployment, taking the numbers of 1618 year-olds not in education, employment or training to historic lows we will provide support to those 16 17 year- olds still not in education, employment or training and tothose who risk becoming so jobcentre plus advisers will work with schools and colleges to supplement careers advice and provide routes into work experience and apprenticeships but it is not fair  on taxpayers, or on young people themselves that 18-21 year-olds with no work experience should slip straight into a life on benefits without first contributing to their community so we will introduce tougher day one work requirements for young people claiming out-of-work benefits. we will replace the jobseekers allowance for 18-21 year-olds with a youth allowance that will be time-limited to six months, after which young people will have to take an apprenticeship, a traineeship or do daily community work for their benefits. it is also not fair that taxpayers should have to pay for 18-21 year-olds on jobseekers allowance to claim housing benefit in order to leave home. so we will ensure that they no longer have an automatic entitlement to housing benefit.we will reward entrepreneurshipto support jobs, we cut corporation tax from 28 to 20 per cent over the course of the parliament, reduced national insurance bills and capped the rise in business rates we have extended 100 per cent small business rate reliefand are providing extra support for high street shops by increasing the business rates retail discount to 1,500 in the next parliament, we want to maintain the most competitive business tax regime in the g20, and oppose labours plans to increase corporation tax we will conduct a major review into business rates by the end of 2015 to ensure that from 2017 they properly reflect the structure of our modern economy and provide clearer billing, better information sharing and a more efficient appeal systemwe will protect you from disruptive and undemocratic strike actionstrikes should only ever be the result of a clear, positive decision based on a ballot in which at least half the workforce has voted this turnout threshold will be an important and fair step to rebalance the interests of employers, employees, the public and the rights of trade unions we will, in addition, tackle the disproportionate impact of strikes in essential public services by introducing a tougher threshold in health, education, fire and transport. industrial action in these essential services would require the support of at least 40 per cent of all those entitledto take part in strike ballots  as well as a majority ofthe conservative party manifesto 201518the conservative party manifesto 2015britain has the most competitive business tax regime in the g20  and we want to keep it that waythose who actually turn out to vote we will also repeal nonsensical restrictions banning employers from hiring agency staff to provide essential cover during strikes; and ensure strikes cannot be called on the basis of ballots conducted years before we will tackle intimidation of non-striking workers; legislate to ensure trade unionsuse a transparent opt-in process for union subscriptions; tighten the rules around taxpayer-funded paid facility time for union representatives; and reform the role of the certification officer.we will cut red tape, boost start-ups and small businessesthis government was the first in post-war history to reduce the burden of regulation we will cut a further 10 billion of red tape over the next parliament through our red tape challenge and our one-in- two-out rule this will support our aim to make britain the best place in europe, and one of the top five worldwide, to do business by 2020 we will also treble our successful start up loans programme during the next parliament so that 75,000 entrepreneurs get the chance to borrow money to set up their own business we will

you:our goal is a country that not only rewards those who work hard and do the right thing, but gives everyone  no matter their background  the chance to fulfil their potential. achieving this means seeing through our major reforms of tax and welfare. we will:cut income tax for 30 million people, taking everyone who earns less than 12,500 out of income tax altogetherpass a new law so that nobody working 30 hours on the minimum wage pays income tax on what they earnback aspiration by raising the 40p tax threshold  so that no one earning less than 50,000 pays itcap overall welfare spending, lower the amount of benefits that any household can receive to 23,000 and continue to roll out universal credit, to make work paybring in tax-free childcare to support parents back into work, and give working parents of 3 and 4-year-olds 30 hours of free childcare a week.under labour, those who worked hard found more and more of their earnings taken away in tax to supporta welfare system that allowed, and even encouraged, people to choose benefits when they could be earning a living this sent out terrible signals: if you did the right thing, you were penalised  and if you did the wrong thing, you were rewarded, with the unfairness of it all infuriating hardworking peoplewe have cut income tax for over 26 million people  and taken over 3 million people out of income tax altogetherover the last five years, we have cut peoples taxes wherever possible we have raised the tax-free personal allowance to 10,600 from 6,475: over 26 million people are now keeping more of their hard-earned money and 3 million of the lowest paid are paying noincome tax at all we believe that cutting peoples taxes is the right thing to do  not only because it is your money, but also because cutting the taxes of the lowest paid and helping them stand on their own two feet is the most effective poverty-tackling measure there is.real fairness means that where people really cannot work, they must be supported  but where they areable to work, they should we have made long overdue changes to our welfare system. we have capped benefits so no household can take more in out-of-work benefits than the average household earns by going out to work we have begun to introduce universal credit  a wayto simplify benefits into a new single payment  so that work always pays we are reassessing those on incapacity benefits so that help goes to those who really need it. the days of something for nothing are over  and all this has helped to reduce by 900,000 the number of people

people out of a 40p higher rate tax band originally meant to capture only the wealthy and we will see through our welfare reforms, lowering the benefit cap and rolling out universal credit, to make the system fairer and reward hard workour plan of action:we will reward worka conservative government will not increase the rates of vat, income tax or national insurance in the next parliament instead, we will ease the burden of taxation by raising the tax-free personal allowance  the amount you can earn before you start paying tax  to 12,500 this will cut income tax for 30 million people and take everyone who earns less than 12,500 out of income tax altogether that means by the end of the decade, one million more people on the lowest wages will be lifted out of income tax, and people who work for 30 hours a week on the increased national minimum wage will no longer pay any income tax at all we will passa new law so that the personal allowance automatically rises in line with the national minimum wage the new tax free minimum wage law will be applied from the first budget after the general election. the change will update the 1977 'rooker-wise' amendment which forced governments to uprate tax thresholds in line with inflation, meaning the personal allowance will now increase more quicklywe will cut income tax for 30 million people  so that hard work is always rewardedwe will back your ambitionthe 40p tax rate was only supposed to be paid by the best-off people in our country. but in the past couple of decades, far too many have been dragged into itwe have already announced an above-inflation increase in the threshold next year now we will raise the 40p tax threshold much further, so that no one earning less than 50,000 pays the higher rate of income tax the 800,000 people earning between 42,385 and 50,000 will no longer pay the 40p rate of taxwe will support you as you raise your familywe will support you, whether you choose to go out to work or stay at home to raise your children we willback the institution of marriage in our society, enabling married couples to transfer 1,060 of their tax-free income to their husband or wife, where the highest earner is a basic rate taxpayer this applies to civil partnerships too, and the transferable amount will always rise at least in line with the personal allowance and we will help families stay together and handle the stresses of modern life by continuing to invest at least 75 million a year in relationship supportwe will bring in tax-free childcare to help parents return to work, and give working parents of three and four year-olds 30 hours of free childcare a weekwe have already legislated to introduce tax-free childcare in the next parliament  worth up to 2,000 per child per year  to help parents who want to work we introduced 15 hours a week of free childcare for all three and four-year olds and the most deprived two- year-olds and because working families with children under school age face particularly high childcare costs, in the next parliament we will give families where all parents are working an entitlement to 30 hours of free childcare for their three and four year-oldswe will cap the uk's overall welfare spending, to save you moneywe will keep a check on the growth of welfare spending, enabling us to provide a system that is fair to those who need

causes of poverty: entrenched worklessness, family breakdown, problem debt, and drug and alcohol dependencywe will reduce the household benefit cap to make the system fairerwe will lower the maximum amount that a single household can claim in benefits each year from 26,000 to 23,000, so we reward work we will continue to have exemptions from the cap for those receiving disability living allowance

from treatment should get the medical help they need so they can return to work if they refuse a recommended treatment, we will review whether their benefits should be reduced. we will also provide significant new support for mental health, benefiting thousands of people claiming out-of-work benefits or being supported by fit for work.28the conservative party manifesto 2015controlled immigration that benefits britainour commitment to you:our plan to control immigration will put you, your family and the british people first. we will reduce the number of people coming to our country with tough new welfare conditions and robust enforcement. we will:keep our ambition of delivering annual net migration in the tens of thousands, not the hundreds of thousandscontrol migration from the european union, by reforming welfare rulesclamp down on illegal immigration and abuse of the minimum wageenhance our border security and strengthen the enforcement of immigration rules develop a fund to ease pressure on local areas and public services.conservatives believe in controlled immigration, not mass immigration. immigration brings real benefits to britain  to our economy, our culture and our national life we will always be a party that is open, outward- looking and welcoming to people from all aroundthe world we also know that immigration must be controlled when immigration is out of control, it puts pressure on schools, hospitals and transport; and it can cause social pressures if communities find it hard to integratewe must work to control immigration and put britain firstbetween 1997 and 2009, under the last labour government, we had the largest influx of people britain had ever seen their open borders policy, combined with their failure to reform welfare, meant that foryears over 90 percent of employment growth in this country was accounted for by foreign nationals  even though there were 14 million people who spent mostof the 2000s living on out-of-work benefits. for the past five years, we have been working to turn around the situation we inheritedsince 2010, we have stripped more than 850 boguscolleges of their rights to sponsor foreign students; installed proper exit checks at our borders; cracked down on illegal working and sham marriages; madeit harder for people to live in the uk illegally, by restricting their access to bank accounts, driving licences and private housing; and reduced the number ofappeal routes to stop people clogging up our courts with spurious attempts to remain in the country all of this has made a difference. immigration from outside the eu has come down since 2010non-eu migration cut by 13 per cent  and economic migration from outside the eu cappedwe have seen many more people from the eu coming to britain than originally anticipated, principally because our economy has been growing so much more rapidly and creating more jobs than other eu countries as a result, our action has not been enough to cut annual net migration to the tens of thousands that ambition remains the right one but it is clearly going to take more time, more work and more difficult long-term decisions to achieve continuing this vital work will be our priority over the next five years.we will negotiate new rules with the eu, so that peoplecutting your taxes, making welfare fairer and controlling immigration 293. cutting your taxes, making welfare fairer and controlling immigrationthe conservative party manifesto 2015will have to be earning here for a number of years before they can claim benefits, including the tax credits that top up low wages instead of something-for- nothing, we will build a system based on the principleof something-for-something we will then put these changes to the british people in a straight in-out referendum on our membership of the european union by the end of 2017 at the same time, we will continue to strengthen our borders, improve the enforcement of our immigration laws and act to make sure people leave at the end of their visas across the spectrum, from the student route to the family and work routes, we will build a system that truly puts you, your family and the british people first.our plan of action:we will regain control of eu migration by reforming welfare ruleschanges to welfare to cut eu migration will be an absolute requirement in the renegotiation we have already banned housing benefit for eu jobseekers, and restricted other benefits, including jobseeker's allowance. we will insist that eu migrants who want to claim tax credits and child benefit must live here and contributeto our country for a minimum of four years this will reduce the financial incentive for lower-paid, lower- skilled workers to come to britain we will introduce a new residency requirement for social housing, so that eu migrants cannot even be considered for a council house unless they have been living in an area for at least four years if an eu migrants child is living abroad, then they should receive no child benefit or child tax credit, no matter how long they have worked in the uk andno matter how much tax they have paid to reduce the numbers of eu migrants coming to britain, we will end the ability of eu jobseekers to claim any job-seeking benefits at all. and if jobseekers have not found a job within six months, they will be required to leavetougher tests for migrants before they can claim benefitswe will tackle criminality and abuse of free movementwe will negotiate with the eu to introduce stronger powers to deport criminals and stop them coming back, and tougher and longer re-entry bans for all those who abuse free movement we want to toughen requirements for non-eu spouses to join eu citizens, including with an income threshold and english language test and when new countries are admitted to the eu in future, we will insist that free movement cannot apply to those new members until their economies have converged much more closely with existing member stateswe will continue to cut immigration from outside the euwe have already capped the level of skilled economic migration from outside the eu we will maintain our cap at 20,700 during the next parliament this will ensure that we only grant visas to those who have the skills we really need in our economy we will reform the student visa system with new measures to tackle abuse and reduce the numbers of students overstaying once their visas expire our action will include clamping down on the number of so-called satellite campuses opened in london by universities located elsewherein the uk, and reviewing the highly trusted sponsor system for student visas and as the introduction of exit checks will allow us to place more responsibility on visa sponsors for migrants who overstay, we will introduce targeted sanctions for those colleges or businesses that fail to ensure that migrants comply with the terms of their visawe will strengthen the enforcement of immigration ruleswe have introduced a deport first, appeal later rulefor foreign national offenders. we will now removeeven more illegal immigrants by extending this rule to all immigration appeals and judicial reviews, including where a so-called right to family life is involved, apart from asylum claims we will also implement a new removals strategy to take away opportunities for spurious legal challenge and opportunities to abscond we will introduce satellite tracking for every foreign national offender subject to an outstanding deportation order or deportation proceedings and we will implement the30the conservative party manifesto 2015requirement for all landlords to check the immigration status of their tenantswe will tackle people trafficking and exploitationwe have already re-introduced a proper system of exit checks across the country, passed a modern slavery act that will protect people from exploitation, and quadrupled the fines for unscrupulous employers who undercut the minimum wage now we will introduce tougher labour market regulation to tackle illegal working and exploitation to crack down further on illegal working, we will harness data from multiple agencies, including exit checks data, to identify illegal immigrants and businesses that employ illegal workers and to incentivise tougher action on employers who do not pay the minimum wage, we will allow inspection teams to reinvest more of the money raised by fines levied on employerswe will ease pressure on public services and your local communitywe are taking unprecedented action to tackle health tourism and will recover up to 500 million from migrants who use the nhs by the middle of the next parliament to help communities experiencing high and unexpected volumes of immigration, we will introducea new controlling migration fund to ease pressures on services and to pay for additional immigration enforcement to prevent sectors becoming partially or wholly reliant on foreign workers, we will require those regularly utilising the shortage occupation list, under which they can bring skilled foreign workers into the uk, to provide long-term plans for training british workerswe will protect british values and our way of lifewe will promote integration and british valuesbeing able to speak english is a fundamental part of integrating into our society we have introduced tough new language tests for migrants and ensured councils reduce spending on translation services next, wewill legislate to ensure that every public sector worker operating in a customer-facing role must speak fluent english and to encourage better integration into our society, we will also require those coming to britain on a family visa

independently we believe that teaching is a highly skilled profession, and that we need to attract the best graduates into it and we believe that there is no substitute for a rigorous academic curriculum to secure the best from every pupilwe inherited a system where far too many children left school without the qualifications and skills they needed. one in three children was leaving primary school unable to read, write and add up properly the number of pupils studying the core academic subjects at gcse had halved our schools had fallen down the global league tablesfor maths and science and the poorest children were attending the weakest schoolsour far-reaching education reforms have changed this we have brought high standards back to teaching, discipline back to schools, and challenging subjects back onto the curriculum today, there are a million more pupils in schools rated by ofsted as good or outstanding overa thousand schools that were ranked inadequate have become academies, bringing in new leadership to promote discipline, rigour and higher standardsthere are over 250 new free schools  set up and run by local people  delivering better education for the

benefiting from academy status, giving them more power over discipline and budgets and nearly 800 of the worst-performing primary schools have been taken over by experienced academy sponsors with a proven track record of success this is improving education for our children so wewill continue to expand academies, free schools, studio schools and university technical colleges over the next

well-funded local authorities in the country, and will make this the baseline for their funding in the next parliament we will not allow state schools to make a profit.we will back your childs

how to deal with the low level disruption that stops children from learning properly this generation of teachers is already the best-qualified ever. in future, we will recruit and keep the best teachers by reducing the time they spend on paperwork, introducing bursaries for the most in-demand subjects, paying good teachers more, further reducing the burden of ofsted inspections and continuing to encourage the growth of teach first we will increase the number of teachers able to teach mandarin in schools in england, so we can compete in the global race we want teachers to be

society is a vision of a more engaged nation, one in which we take more responsibility for ourselves and our neighbours; communities working together, not depending on remote and impersonal bureaucracies. of course, there are many tasks which require the resources and grip of government. but there are also many areas of nationallife in which we need more people to step forward, take responsibility and play their part. this is about a national culture change, saying to everyone in britain: ask what you can do for your community and your country.volunteering is at a 10-year high,

generation of teenagers has undertaken national citizen service (ncs), developing their skills, broadening their horizons and growing in confidence; over the next five years, we will expand ncs  so it becomes a rite of passage for young people in our country. we will give more people the power and support to run a school, start their own social enterprise, and take over their own local parks, landmarks and pubs. we will encourage the 1,400 communities engaged in neighbourhood planning to complete the process and assist others to draw up their own plans. and we will take new steps to encourage volunteering, enabling more people to join the unsung heroes who are the backbone of communities across britain.our plan of action:we will expand national citizen serviceover 130,000 young people have graduated from ncs and we have now guaranteed a place on ncs for every 16 and 17-year-old who wants one. in addition to this, we will increase the number of cadet units in schools,

bisexual and transgender people we will build on the posthumous pardon of enigma codebreaker alan turing, who committed suicide following his conviction for gross indecency, with a broader measure to lift the blight of outdated convictions of this nature thousands of british men still suffer from similar historic charges, even though they would be completely innocent of any crime today many others are dead and cannot correct this injustice themselves through the legal process we have introduced while in government so we will introduce a new law that will pardon those people, and right these

improves peoples lives. whitehall is now leaner and smaller than at any time since the second world war. we have halvedthe running costs of the department for education. we have abolished or merged over 300 quangos. we have moved paperwork online. we have shone a bright light on government spending  requiring all central government spending over 25,000 to be published online. we have also ensured that people receive a transparent breakdown of how their taxes are spent.in the next five years, we will ensure this efficiency revolution continues. we will also continue to reform our political system: make votes of more equal value through long overdue boundary reforms, reducing the number of mps and ensuring the electoral commission does more14.3 billion was saved in 2014 through efficiencies in government  equivalent to nearly 850 for every working householdto tackle voting fraud. these measures will help to restore public confidence in british politics.our plan of action:we will cut government wastewe have reduced the cost of government, by selling empty buildings, managing big projects better, shrinking the civil service, reforming pensions, moving more services online, and improving contracting. we plan a further 10 billion annual savings by 2017-18 and 15- 20 billion in 2019-20.to eliminate the deficit, we must continue to cut out wasteful

heart of our approach to government over the last five years, we have been open about government spending, provided access to taxpayer-funded research, pursuedopen data and helped establish the open

government to account, with reforms such as the election of select committee chairs and the creation of the backbench business committee, which enables backbenchers, for the first time, to determine a significant proportion of the house of commons business we have also passed the fixed term parliament act, an unprecedented transfer of executive power inthe next parliament, we will address the unfairness of the current parliamentary boundaries, reduce the numberof mps to 600 to cut the cost of politics and make votesof more equal value we will implement the boundary reforms that parliament has already approved and make them apply automatically once the boundary commission reports in 2018 this will deal with the fact that the current electoral layout over-represents parts of the country where populations have been falling and under-represents parts where populations have been risingwe will ensure that the house of lords fulfils its valuable role as a chamber of legislative scrutiny and revisionwhile we still see a strong case for introducing an elected element into our second chamber, this is not a priority inthe next parliament we have already allowed for

good it feels when you have worked long hours, saved money for years, and finally take possession of the keys to your first home. for years, however, people have been finding it harder and harder to get on the housing ladder under labour, house- building fell to its lowest peacetime level since the 1920s developers were building too few homes andthe aftermath of the banking crisis saw young people struggling to raise a deposithouse building at its highest since 2007these past five years have been about reversing this trend we have unblocked the planning system, to help builders start building again we have introduced help to buy, making it much easier for people to secure a mortgage and we have reinvigorated the right to buy which labour had cut back, extending home ownership to a whole new generation of social tenants as a result, over 200,000 people have been helped either on or up the housing ladder most of those helped have been young first-time buyers spread right across our country.everyone who works hard should be able to own a home of their ownas the party of home ownership, we want to go further and faster  and this manifesto sets out our plan at its heart, a clear objective to build affordable homes, including 200,000 starter homes which will be sold at a 20 per cent discount, and will be built exclusively for first time buyers under the age of 40 at the same time, we will extend our help to buy equity loan scheme, introduce a new help to buy isa, extend the right to buy to housing association tenants and make sure that, when it comes to planning decisions, local people are in chargeand for all those already in their home, we will make sure we continue working through our economic plan, so mortgage rates stay lower for longer and people can

helping one million more people to own their own home we will extend help to buy to cover another 120,000 homes  in total helping over 200,000 people and we will continue the help to buy mortgage guarantee until the start of 2017, and the help to buy equity loan until at least 2020 from this autumn, we will introduce a new help to buy isa to support people who are working hard to save up for a deposit for their first home. a ten per cent deposit on the average first home costs 15,000, so if you putin up to 12,000, government will put in up to 3,000 more a 25 per cent top-up is equivalent to saving a deposit from your pre-tax income  making it effectively a tax cut for first-time buyers.our new help to buy isa will support people who are working hard to save for a depositwe will build 200,000 starter homes and more affordable housingwe will build 200,000 quality starter homes over the course of the next parliament, reserved for first-time buyers under 40 and sold at 20 per

associations to enable more people to buy a home of their own it is unfair that they should miss out on a right enjoyed by tenants in local authority homes we will fund the replacement of properties sold under the extended right to buy by requiring local authorities to manage their housing assets more efficiently, with the most expensive properties sold off and replaced as they fall vacant. we will also create a brownfield fund to unlock homes on brownfield land for additional housing.we will give you the right to buildwe aim at least to double the number of custom-built and self-built homes by 2020, and we will take forward a new right to build, requiring councils to allocate land to local people to build or commission their own home, as you can do in most of europewe will protect the green beltwe have safeguarded national green belt protection and increased protection of important green spaces we have abolished the labour governments top-down regional strategies which sought to delete the green belt in and around 30 towns and cities and introduced a new local green space planning designation which allows councils and neighbourhood plans to give added protection to valuable local green spaceswe will support locally-led garden cities and towns and prioritise brownfield development, making sure new homes are always matched by the necessary infrastructure to support themwe will support locally-led garden cities and towns in places where communities want them, such as ebbsfleet and bicester when new homes are granted planning permission, we will make sure local communitiesknow up-front that necessary infrastructure such as schools and roads will be provided we will ensure that brownfield land is used as much as possible for new development we will require local authorities to have a register of what is available, and ensure that 90 per cent52of suitable brownfield sites have planning permission for housing by 2020 to meet the capitals housing needs, we will create a new london land commission, with a mandate to identify and release all surplus brownfield land owned by the public sector we will fund housing zones to transform brownfield sites into new housing, which will create 95,000 new homesaverage council tax bills in england have fallen, in real terms, by 11 per centwe will help keep your council taxes lowunder this government, average council tax bills in england have fallen, in real terms, by 11 per cent whereas labour wants to propose a new tax on family homes, we will help local authorities keep council taxlow for hardworking taxpayers, and ensure residentscan continue to veto high rises via a local referendum and in london, where there is a conservative mayor, bills have fallen even further we will continue to work with councillors to deliver high quality, value for money services we will encourage voluntary integration of services and administration between and within councilsfor example, with the troubled families programme and the better care fund  to promote savings and improve local services we want local councils to help manage public land and buildings, and will give them at least a 10 per cent stake in public sector land sales in their areawe will help you build a strong local economywe want local authorities to help create strong local economies building on the local retention of business rates introduced in 2012, we will promote localism by allowing councils to keep a higher proportion of the business rates revenue that is generated in their area this will provide a strong financial incentive for councils to promote economic growth we will review how we can further reduce ring-fencing and remove whitehall burdens to give councils more flexibility to supportlocal services we will support business improvement districts and other forms of business-led collaboration on high streets  giving more say to local traders on issues such as minor planning applications, cleaning and parking we will continue to support local shops and residents in tackling aggressive parking enforcement and excessive parking charges, and take steps to tackle rogue and

green and pleasant land is not some relic from a bygone era, to be mourned and missed: its the living, breathing backdrop to our national life our moors and meadows, wildlife and nature, air and water are a crucial part of our national identity and make our country what it is so we care about them deeply, want to protect them for everyone and pass them onto future generationslabour never understood this our rural communities fell further behind urban areas; biodiversity suffered, with important species and habitats declining under their watch; and they failed to protect the green beltover the last five years, we have committed billions of pounds to reduce emissions from transport and clean up our rivers and seas we have done more to protect our seas, safeguarded our green belt and planted 11 million trees and we set out a comprehensive, long-term vision to protect our natural heritage in this countrys first white paper on the natural environment for 20 yearsover the next five years, we will put in place stronger protections for our natural landscapes, establish a new blue belt to safeguard precious marine habitats, launch a programme of pocket parks in towns and

enabling us, among other things, to clean up our rivers and lakes, protect our stonewalls and hedges, and help our bees to thrive we will ensure that our public forestsand woodland are kept in trust for the nation and plant another 11 million trees we will make it easier to access our beautiful landscapes, by providing free, comprehensive maps of all open-access green space building on our introduction of a five pence charge on single-use plastic bags, we will review the case for higher fixed penalty notices for littering and allow councils to tackle small-scale fly-tipping through

homes54the conservative party manifesto 2015we will build new infrastructure in an environmentally-sensitive waywe will build new roads and railways in a way that limits, as far as possible, their impact on the environment this includes investing 300 million in cutting light pollution from new roads, doing more tunnelling, building better noise barriers and helping to restore lost habitat wewill also replace locally any biodiversity lost in the construction of high speed 2 we set up the natural capital committee to put hard economic numbers on the value of our environment, and we will extend its life to at least the end of the next parliament we will work with it to develop a 25 year plan to restore the uks biodiversity, and to ensure that both public and private investment in the environment is directed where we need it mostwe want to protect our environment for future generationswe will create a blue belt to protect precious marine habitatsearlier this year, we announced the creation of a new marine protected area around the pitcairn islands  the largest protected expanse of sea in the world we will now go even further, creating a blue belt around the uks 14 overseas territories, subject to local support and environmental need we will designate a further protected area at ascension island, subject to the views of the local community. and, off our own coasts, we will completethe network of marine conservation zones that we have already started, to create a uk blue belt of protected siteswe will protect animal welfarethe quality of the food on your plate,

high welfare standards we will encourage other countries to follow the eus lead in banning animal testing for cosmetics and work to accelerate the global development and take-up of alternatives to animal testing where appropriate we want people to integrate fully into british society, but that does not mean they should have to give up the things they hold dear in their religion so while we will

ensure your homes and businesses have energy supplies they can rely onhelp you insulate your homehalt the spread of subsidised onshore wind farmsmeet our climate change commitments, cutting carbon emissions as cheaply as possible, to save you moneywithout secure energy supplies, we leave british families and business at the mercy of fluctuating global oil and gas prices; we increase our dependence on foreign sources of energy; and we become less safe and less prosperous as a resultnational energy policy demands a willingness to take decisions today for the good of tomorrow but labour took the opposite approach power margins  the safety cushion we need to prevent blackouts  have fallen to record lows because of their historic failure to investin new capacity domestic sources of oil and gas were unexploited and labour failed to deliver the next generation of energy projects that will help us keep the lights on, drive bills down and reduce carbon emissionsall this hurt consumers the number of major energy suppliers halved and energy bills soared, with the average gas bill more than doublingwe have taken a different approach. where labour was chronically short-termist, we have secured decent, affordable energy supplies not just for the coming years, but for the coming decadesour long-term plan has unlocked 59 billion of investment in electricity all parts of the uk will soon be helping to deliver secure, affordable and low-carbon energy, from the hinkley point nuclear power station, towithout secure energy supplies our country becomes less safe and less prosperousoffshore wind turbine manufacturing at the new green port in hull, the next generation of pipelines west of shetland and the swansea tidal lagoon our tax cuts have encouraged record levels of investment in existing north sea gas, and the birth of a new industry, shale gas, which could create many thousands of jobsand we have delivered a better deal for consumers too we have demanded that energy companies simplify their tariffs; encouraged more independent suppliers  which now account for ten per cent of the household market; and made it much easier for people to switch energy providersbut the job is only half done we need a conservative government to see through this long-term planand secure clean but affordable energy supplies for generations to come. this means a significant expansion in new nuclear and gas; backing good-value green energy; and pushing for more new investment in uk energy sources healthy competition, not short-termist56the conservative party manifesto 2015political intervention, is the best way to secure a good deal for consumers so we will keep on relentlessly pushing for more competition to keep bills lowthis is a long-term plan to keep the lights on; keep our homes warm; and keep families from endless worry about their energy billsunder labour, the average gas bill more than doubledour plan of action:we will promote competition to keep your bills as low as possiblewe have helped increase the number of independent energy suppliers from seven to 21, made it easier for customers to switch to better deals, slashed the numberof tariffs to just 4 per supplier, and cut switching timesin half we will go even further, implementing the recommendations of the competition and markets authority investigation that we triggered we will ensure that every home and business in the country has a smart meter by 2020, delivered as cost-effectively as possible,so consumers have instant, accurate bills and can switch to an alternative provider within one day and we will support low-cost measures on energy efficiency, with the goal of insulating a million more homes over the next five years,

start-up funding for promising new renewable technologies and research, but will only give significant support to those that clearly represent value for moneywe will halt the spread of onshore windfarmsonshore wind now makes a meaningful contributionto our energy mix and has been part of the necessary increase in renewable capacity onshore windfarms often fail to win public support, however, and are unable by themselves to provide the firm capacity that a stable energy system requires as a result, we will end any new public subsidy for them and change the law so that local people have the final say on windfarm applications.we will protect our planet for our childrenwe have been the greenest government ever, settingup the worlds first green investment bank, signing a deal to build the first new nuclear plant in a generation, trebling renewable energy generation to 19 per cent, bringing energy efficiency measures to over one million homes, and committing 1 billion for carbon capture and storage. we are the largest offshore wind marketin the world we will push for a strong global climate deal later this year  one that keeps the goal of limiting global warming to

crime means fewer robberies, less violence on our streets, fewer lives ruined, and more people able to feel confident about the futurelabour didnt trust our brilliant policemen and women, probation staff and prison officers to do their job, but tried to micromanage every police force from whitehall, doing serious damage to officer morale, police discretion and forces performance and labour failed to provide sufficient prison places: tens of thousands of prisoners were released early, putting the public at riskwe have made progress in turning around the situation we inherited, with comprehensive reforms to policing, rehabilitation and the rights of victims we have already increased the proportion of officers working on the frontline, and cut 45 million hours of police paperwork we have given chief constables a clear mandate to cut crime, reformed stop and search, established the national crime agency, strengthened the police inspectorate, made the police more accountable through police and crime commissioners, increased transparency through crime maps, and set up the college of policing to drive up professional standardswe have made sure that 45,000 offenders will now receive supervision and rehabilitation on release from prison,with providers paid according to the results they achieve in reducing reoffending. we reformed drug treatment so that abstinence and

lengths for the most serious offences, and making sure that prisons are places of rehabilitationwe need to complete our revolution in the way we manage offenders in the community, using the latest technology to keep criminals on the straight and narrow and we must also become smarter when it comes to crime prevention, dealing with the drivers of crime such as drugs and alcohol so we will focus not only on punishment, but also58on rehabilitating offenders and intervening early to prevent troubled young people being drawn into crimeour plan of action:we will finish the job of police

stopping vulnerable people being detained in police custody to speed up justice, we will extend the use of police-led prosecutions we will allow police forces to retain a greater percentage of the

attached to their punishment we will create a blanket ban on all new psychoactive substances, protecting young people from exposure to so-called legal highs and we will make sobriety orders available to all courts in england and wales, enforced through new alcohol monitoring tagswe will reform our prison systemdespite making savings in the prison budget, there are around 3,000 more adult male prison places today than in 2010. we will make further savings by closing old, inefficient prisons, building larger, modern and fit-for-purpose ones and expanding payment-by-results and we will introduce widespread random testing of drug use in jails, new body scanners, greater use of mobile phone blocking technology and a new strategy to tackle corruption in prisonsthere are around 3,000 more adult male prison places today than in 2010we will protect victims and support the vulnerablewe have already introduced a new victims code and taken steps to protect vulnerable witnesses and victims now we will strengthen victims rights further, witha new victims law that will enshrine key rights for victims, including the right to make a personal statement and have it read in court before sentencing  and before the parole board decides on a prisoner's release wewill give all vulnerable victims and witnesses greater opportunity to give evidence outside court, and roll out

intelligence agencies and counter-terrorism policing but the scale of the threat to our country from a number of terrorist groups remains serious, and the rise of isil in syria and iraq has created new havens for terrorists from which attacks against britain can be planned, financed and directed.we will always do whatever is necessary to protect the british peoplehowever, the nature of the threat we face is makingit more difficult for the security services to identify terrorist plots  especially thanks to new technology we must always ensure our outstanding intelligence and security agencies have the powers they need to keepus safe at the same time, we continue to reject any suggestions of sweeping, authoritarian measures that would threaten our hard-won freedoms in the last year alone, we have given the authorities greater powers to disrupt and control the movements of people who want to travel abroad to fight, including strengthening powers to confiscate the passports

was right to create the scottish parliament and welsh assembly, but the job was not finished. without the ability to raise money, the devolved parliaments were not accountable to taxpayers without devolution to local councils and communities, power felt as distant as ever and one fundamental unfairness remains today: scottish mps are able to cast the decisive vote on matters that only affected england and wales, while english and welsh mps cannot vote on matters that only affect scotland this leaves a space for resentment to fester  and put our union in jeopardywe have tackled the problems

more cohesive and united and we have set out clear plans for english votes for english lawsall this reflects a core conservative belief: power to the people around britain you can see that principle in practicein town halls, councillors now have more of a say over public spending in communities, local people have the right tovote in referendums on council tax rises neighbourhoods are deciding what is built in their area and what happens to assets such as parks and public buildingswe believe in giving power to hardworking taxpayers, letting you decide on the issues that affect you and your familyour commitment to the union means we want to strengthen it we will let local people have more say on local planning and let them vote on local issues we will not let anyone impose artificial regions on england  our traditional towns, boroughs, cities and counties are here to stay we will continue devolution settlementsfor scotland and wales, and implement the stormont house agreement in northern ireland and we will give english mps a veto over english-only matters, including on income tax  answering the west lothian questionin the last five years, we have proven that we are the party of the union we will go further in the next parliament, pushing power out beyond westminster, cardiff bay, holyrood and stormont, so we keep our united kingdom strong and secure for the long termkeeping our country secure697. keeping our country securethe conservative party manifesto 2015our plan of action:we will build an enduring settlement for the united kingdomwe will work to ensure a stable constitution that is fair to the people of england, scotland, wales, and northern ireland we will strengthen and improve devolutionfor each part of our united kingdom in a way that accepts that there is no one-size-fits-all solution: we will implement the smith commission and st davids day agreement or equivalent changes in the rest of the uk, including english votes for english lawswe will give english mps a veto over matters only affecting englandwe will maintain the westminster parliament as the uk and englands law-making body but we want parliament to work in a way that ensures decisions affecting england,or england and wales, can only be taken with the consent of the majority of mps representing constituencies in england, or in england and wales we will end the manifest unfairness whereby scotland is able to decide its own laws in devolved areas, only for scottish mps also to be able to have the potentially decisive say on similar matters that affect only england and wales we will maintain the integrity of the uk parliament by ensuring that mps from all parts of the uk continue to deliberate and vote together, including to set overall spending levels but we will:change parliamentary procedures so that the detail of legislation affecting only england or england and wales will be considered by a committee drawn in proportion to party strength in england or england and walesadd a new stage to how english legislation is passed; no bill or part of a bill relating only to england would be able to pass to its third reading and become law without being approved through a legislative consent motion by a grand committee made up of all english mps, or all english and welsh mpsextend the principle of english consent to financial matters such as how spending is distributed within england and to taxation  including an english rate of income tax  when the equivalent decisions have been devolved to scotlandwe will honour in full our commitments to scotlanda new scotland bill will be in our first queens speech and will be introduced in the first session of a new parliament. we will implement the recommendations of the smith commission so that more than 50 per cent of the scottish parliaments budget will be funded from revenues raised in scotland and it will have significant new welfare powers to complement existing devolved powers in health and social care we will provide the scottish parliament with one of the most extensive packages of tax and spending powersof any devolved legislature in the world we will retain the barnett formula as the basis for determining the grantto cover that part of the scottish parliaments budget not funded by tax revenues raised in scotland we will agree new rules with the scottish government for how the block grant will be adjusted, to take account of the new devolved tax and welfare powers and we will ensure that where responsibility for taxation has been devolved, tax changes only affect public spending in that part of the country.we will implement wales devolution settlementwe will clarify the division of powers between wales and the uk government we will:devolve to the welsh assembly control over its own affairs  including the assembly name, size and electoral system, assembly elections and voting ageimplement other recommendations of the second silk report where there is all-party support as set out in the st davids day agreement; this will include devolving to the welsh assembly important economic powers over ports and energy consentsintroduce a new wales bill if these changes require legislationcontinue to reserve policing and justice as matters for the uk parliamentintroduce a funding floor to protect welsh relative funding and provide certainty for the welsh government to plan for the future, once it has called a referendum on income tax powers in the next parliament70the conservative party manifesto 2015make the welsh government responsible for raising more of the money it spends so the welsh people can hold their politicians to accountwe will continue to build a northern ireland where politics works, the economy grows and society is strongwe will maintain northern irelands position within the united kingdom on the basis of the consent of its people our strong support for the political institutions established over the past two decades as a result of the various agreements will continue we will:put the safety and security of the people of northern ireland as our highest priority we will develop and implement our strategy to combat terrorism, giving the strongest possible support to the brave men andwomen of the police service of northern irelandwork to implement fully and faithfully the historic stormont house agreement to enable devolution to function more effectively; to deal with the legacy of the past; and to make progress on divisive issues such as flags and parading.continue to work closely with the northern ireland executive to implement commitments in the 2013 economic pact to rebalance the economy and to build a more united and stronger societycomplete the devolution of corporation tax powers to the assembly, consistent with the executive fulfilling its commitments on finance, welfare reform and efficiencies in the stormont house agreement.keeping our country secure717. keeping our country securethe conservative party manifesto 2015real change in our relationship with the european unionour commitment to you:for too long, your voice has been ignored on europe. we will:give you a say over whether we should stay in or leave the eu, with an in-out referendumby the end of 2017commit to keeping the pound and staying out of the eurozonereform the workings of the eu, which is too big, too bossy and too bureaucraticreclaim power from brussels on your behalf and safeguard british interests in the single marketback businesses to create jobs in britain by completing ambitious trade deals and reducing red tape.the eu needs to change and it is time for the british people  not politicians  to have their say only the conservative party will deliver real change and real choice on europe, with an in-out referendum by the end of 2017labour failed to give you a choice on the eu they handed over major new powers to brussels withoutyour consent, and gave away 7 billion of the british rebate we have taken action in europe to promote your economic security. we cut the eu budget for the firsttime ever, saving british taxpayers 815 billion we took britain out of eurozone bailouts, including for greece  the first ever return of powers from brussels. our prime minister vetoed a new eu treaty that would have damaged britains interests and we have pursued a bold, positive, pro-business agenda, exempting smallest businesses from red tape, promoting free trade, and pushing to extend the single market to new sectors, like digitalwe believe in letting the people decide: so we will hold an in-out referendum on our membership of the eu before the end of 2017but there is much more to do the eu is too bureaucratic and too undemocratic it interferes too much in ourdaily lives, and the scale of migration triggered by new members joining in recent years has had a real impact on local communities we are clear about what we want from europe we say: yes to the single market yes to turbo- charging free trade yes to working together where we are stronger together than alone yes to a family of nation states, all part of a european union  but whose interests, crucially, are guaranteed whether inside the euro or out no to ever closer union. no to a constant flow of power to brussels no to unnecessary interference and no, of course, to the euro, to participation in eurozone bail-outs or notions like a european armyit will be a fundamental principle of a future conservative government that membership of the european union depends on the consent of the british people  and in recent years that consent has worn wafer-thin thats why, after the election, we will negotiate a new settlement for britain in europe, and then ask the british people whether they want to stay in the eu on this reformed basis or leave david cameron has committed that he will only lead a government that offers an in-out referendum. we will hold that in-out referendum before the end of 2017 and respect the outcomeso the choice at this election is clear: labour and the72liberal democrats wont give you a say over the eu ukip cant give you a say only the conservativeparty will deliver real change in europe  and only the conservatives can and will deliver an in-out referendumour plan of action:we will let you decide whether to stay in or leave the euwe will legislate in the first session of the next parliament for an in-out referendum to be held on britains membership of the eu before the end of 2017 we will negotiate a new settlement for britain in the eu and then we will ask the british people whether they want to stayin on this basis, or leave we will honour the result of the referendum, whatever the outcomewe will protect britain's economywe will protect our economy from any further integration of the eurozone. the integration of the eurozone has raised acute questions for non-eurozone countries like the united kingdom. we benefit from the single market and do not want to stand in the way of the eurozone resolving its difficulties. indeed, given the trade between britain and the eurozone countries we want to see these economies returning to growth but we will not let the integration of the eurozone jeopardise the integrity of the single market or in any way disadvantage the ukwe will reclaim powers from brusselswe want to see powers flowing away from brussels, notto it we have already taken action to return around 100 powers, but we want to go further we want national parliaments to be able to work together to block unwanted european legislation and we want an end to our commitment to an ever closer union, as enshrined indavid cameron vetoed a new eu treaty that would have damaged britains interests  the first time in history that a british prime minister has done sothe treaty to which every eu country has to sign up furthermore, we will continue to ensure that defence policy remains firmly under british national control, maintaining nato and the transatlantic relationship as the cornerstones of our defence and security policywe will scrap the human rights actwe will scrap labour's human rights act and introducea british bill of rights which will restore common senseto the application of human rights in the uk the billwill remain faithful to the basic principles of humanrights, which we signed up to in the original european convention on human rights it will protect basic rights, like the right to a fair trial, and the right to life, which are an essential part of a modern democratic society but it will reverse the mission creep that has meant human rights law being used for more and more purposes, and often with little regard for the rights of wider society among other things the bill will stop terrorists and other serious foreign criminals who pose a threat to our society from using spurious human rights arguments to prevent deportationwe will take action in europe to make you better offwe want an eu that helps britain move ahead, notone that holds us back we have already succeededin exempting our smallest businesses from new eu regulations, and kicked-off negotiations for a massiveeu trade deal with the usa, which could be worth billions of pounds to the uk economy we will buildon this we want to preserve the integrity of the single market, by insisting on protections for those countries that have kept their own currencies we want to expand the single market, breaking down the remaining barriers to trade and ensuring that new sectors are openedup to british firms. we want to ensure that new rules target unscrupulous behaviour in the financial services industry, while safeguarding britain as a global centre of excellence in finance. so we will resist eu attempts to restrict legitimate financial services activities. we will press for lower eu spending, further reform of the common agricultural policy and structural funds, and for eu money to be focused on promoting jobs and growththe conservative party manifesto 2015keeping our country secure737. keeping our country securethe
